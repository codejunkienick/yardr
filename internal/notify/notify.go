// Two kinds of source can tell a person: a declared one, by the notify key
// of its file (internal/source), and one yardr has in Go, by
// hooks.Notifier. Both are a provider here, and a third way to reach a
// person (a command the operator sets, say) would be one more.

// Nothing is written by this package: no log, no event. The address of a
// person and the credential of a source are read from their files for one
// send and are in no error it returns.
