// The files a hook delivery carries. The envelope names them by the
// source's own refs (its "files"), recorded with the event as they came;
// the receiver fetches the bytes after the delivery is kept and answered,
// and what it fetched is recorded here, beside the event, since an event
// is never changed once logged. One record per delivery, under the event's
// seq: each file as a blob the yard holds, or, for one it could not take,
// the reason where its hash would be (BlobRef.NotTaken), with the size the
// source gave. A reverse entry per blob, hash then seq, finds the delivery
// that names a blob without scanning every record (DeliveryBlob).
//
// A hook event's own "files" are the source's refs, never BlobRefs:
// EventFiles reads mail and the quiet run's failed and unjudged alone,
// and these records are read here, so the two are never taken for each
// other.
//
// The files land after the delivery is kept, and so after the notification
// of it: a client that read DeliveryFiles then read none. The record is
// logged with a HookFiles event in the same write, so the event is the
// client's word to read again, and what it reads then is there. A delivery
// whose files are never fetched (none carried, no credential, a fetch the
// server's restart cut short) has no record and no event, and reads as none.
