// A bead's rounds are how often it has gone round a loop of its flow: the
// times an outcome brought it back to a stage it had been in (a reviewer's
// changes, a failed landing). Bead.Rounds keeps them per stage, and keeps
// them itself: the ETA's visited list stops at ETAVisitedCap stages while a
// flow may have more, so a return to a stage first reached past the cap
// would never count if the list were read for it.
//
// Every arrival gives its stage a key at zero when it has none, the bead's
// creation and a move by a person included, and a key is what makes a later
// outcome into the stage a return. A move by a person never adds a round:
// whoever moves a bead has already looked at it.

// been reports whether the bead has been in stage before, and the rounds
// counted for it. A key says so. A bead from before Rounds has none, so the
// stages its visited list holds stand for what it had reached, with the cap
// that list already had.

// when a contributors.pr bead leaves ciwait, where a run that held before it
// started may keep it, or leaves contributor for anywhere but ciwait, where a
// push may overtake it before the hand move: either way a later review must
// not reuse it for a new head. A bead that stays where it is keeps it.
