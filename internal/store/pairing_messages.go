// A pairing's codes and messages: what two yards say to each other to
// become peers from a short code one operator reads to the other
// (docs/peers.md, "Pairing"). Moved from internal/pairing (yardr-rxk9),
// where the paths they cross on stay; the host's side is in pairing.go.
//
// The yard that shows the code is the host, the one that calls it the
// joiner. Three messages cross before anyone is asked anything:
//
//	joiner -> host   Hello:        a commitment to the joiner's nonce, name and key
//	host -> joiner   PairingOffer: the host's nonce, name, key and URL
//	joiner -> host   Reveal:       the joiner's nonce, name and key
//
// Each carries an HMAC under a key stretched from the code (PairingKey), so a yard
// that does not know the code gets no further than a counted wrong try.
//
// The code is short, and a short secret used as a key can be guessed by
// whoever sees one HMAC made with it and has the time. So the code is not
// what the link rests on. The check is: six digits from a hash of
// everything that crossed (Transcript.Check), which each operator sees and
// compares with the other's. Someone in the middle who puts a key of their
// own in either direction has to make two hashes agree in those digits, and
// has no say in them: the joiner is bound to its nonce by the commitment
// before it sees the host's, and the host has sent its nonce before the
// joiner's is revealed. One try in a million, and a pairing takes one try.
// That is the commit-then-reveal exchange of a short authentication string
// (Vaudenay 2005; ZRTP and Bluetooth's numeric comparison use it), made of
// SHA-256, HMAC and random nonces and nothing else.
//
// What then proves that each yard holds the private key it gave is not
// here: the confirmations that follow are signed as every request between
// yards is (internal/yardkey).

// TTL is how long a code is good for, from when it is shown. ConfirmTTL is
// how long the two operators then have to compare the check, from the call.
