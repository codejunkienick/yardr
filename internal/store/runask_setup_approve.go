// ApproveSetup approves the setup ask ask on the bead id as actor: the
// preset pick option with the account typed unseen (values), the candidate
// taken (account), or neither where a drift card's standing account is
// kept. In one write it checks the ask and who approves, holds the approval
// to the yard the card was written from, and records an answer that holds
// the preset, the names given, the candidate taken or the kept account,
// and CarryPending, with the carrying record beside it for the server to
// take up. Typed values are handed to the server's memory after the write
// commits, never stored: between the approval and the account's write they
// live there alone. A picked candidate and a kept account hand nothing.
// Where the pack's source names a check call, the typed account is tried
// with it before the write, with no store write open: a refused check
// refuses the approval with the check's words, records nothing and leaves
// the ask open. A check call that names run is tried from a scratch home
// holding the carried programs, first setup and setup again alike
// (setupCheckOf, runSetupCheck).
//
// It refuses an ask that is not on the bead, sets up no pack, or was
// declined, taken back or approved already: a setup runs once for one ask.
// It refuses anyone but the operator, and every call from the pane of an
// agent whatever actor it names (mayApprove). It refuses when the yard
// would not write the same card now (setupStale), and — on a first setup —
// when every grantee holds the picked preset already. Picking YouDecide
// grants the asker's recommended preset, and is refused where none is
// recommended. Where candidates stand, exactly one of the typed values and
// the picked candidate settles the account, and where none stand the typed
// values do; a drift card whose file holds every name is also kept with a
// bare pick, and one with missing names wants those typed. A refused
// approval records nothing and changes nothing, and leaves the ask open.
//
// It is served on the yard's socket, and on the listener to a device of
// the operator and to no other caller (rpc.OperatorCalls), as run
// approvals and secret answers travel. No answer that comes over a link
// approves.
//
// A setup takes the account, so its card is always weighty (weight.go): it
// is approved only by a call that says its person saw the weight first
// (weighed), and without it the approval is refused, changes nothing and
// leaves the ask open (weighedRefusal). The yard checks what the client
