// A device is enrolled by a code as two yards are paired (pairing.go,
// docs/users.md "Enrolled by a code"): the operator opens a pairing for one
// device of one user, the yard shows a code of the kind a pairing of yards
// has, and the device that calls with it is answered with its token. It is
// that pairing's code, its ten minutes, its five wrong tries and its one
// use, and like it an open one is in the server's memory and nowhere else.
//
// What it has not is the check two operators compare. What it has,
// where the device came by the QR's fourth field, is a key of its own:
// the device makes a channel key pair for this yard, redeems the code
// inside a Noise handshake to the yard's channel key, and is recorded
// with its public half pinned beside its token's hash, sealed from
// whoever carried the connection (DevicePairRedeemSealed). A pairing
// redeemed with no key field is the plain one of before: what it is given
// is a bearer token, which whoever reads the connection reads on every call
// after this one. The connection is what a device rests on (docs/api.md,
// "Over the network"), so the code crosses on it as the token does.

// the device could not be added: its user was removed, or a device of its
// name added, while the pairing was open. Its other reasons are pairing's.
