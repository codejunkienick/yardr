// Unfold takes member out of carrier, restored whole: the member reopens in
// to (the flow's first stage when to is empty) with the reason as a note, and
// what the fold moved from it comes back from the provenance its folded edge
// recorded (FoldMoved): its tracking links, its outgoing blocks edges and its
// watches. It is one write, all or nothing. The folded edge is gone, the
// carrier's body gains the taken-out line, and an unfolded event is logged on
// the carrier.
//
// What the carrier keeps is what the fold's moves leave behind: a relates
// link to each issue the member tracks again, as any earlier tracker keeps,
// and whatever other members still folded moved from them. A blocks edge or
// a watch two parts moved stays on the carrier until its last part is out,
// so each part restores exactly what it moved even when parts share a
// target. Two members never moved the same link: an issue has one tracking
// bead, so the fold would have refused the second.
//
// A bead that is not a member of the carrier is refused, as are an open
// member (already out), a closed carrier (nothing is taken out of a
// finished bundle), a blank reason, and a to outside the member's flow or
// in a terminal stage. A bead's agent may unfold the members of its own
// carrier and no other's (checkUnfoldOwn), and only into the flow's first
// stage or one people work (checkAgentStage), as a created bead: into
// review or approved the part would land without the stages before it.
//
// What git must read is read before the write: the member's repository
// flows, which say what stage it reopens in and what its gates read, and
// the gates of what the carrier and the member block, which the write reads
// again.
