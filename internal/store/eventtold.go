// What a person who is no operator is told of an event. An event's data
// is open: the kinds are many, they are written in many places, and a key a
// writer adds says nothing of whether its value is a file of an operator's, a
// command, an address or the words of an error that names one. So the data is
// told by an allow-list, as a device's settings are (deviceSettings):
// eventDataTold names, for each kind, the keys of its data the person is told,
// and every other key is held, as is every key of a kind that has no row. A
// kind added later tells no data until its author lists it, and rpc's
// TestEveryKindIsDecided fails until they do.
//
// What a row lists is what says which thing the event is about and what became
// of it: the names (a crew member, a user, a peer, a source, a hook, a depot,
// a flow, a group), the numbers, the words of a fixed vocabulary (a status, an
// outcome, a reason the yard names itself), and what the stream's contract
// promises (docs/api.md). What a row leaves out is a path on the yard's
// machine, a command, a URL, a pane's screen, the handle of a session, and any
// text that is made of an error or a command's output: a path with words
// around it is still the path, and nothing here scrubs one.
//
// A key whose value is a record can be told in part: a name with a dot, as
// login.groups, lists a field of it, and the key is then told with the fields
// the row lists and no others, so a field the record gains later is held until
// its author lists it, as a key is.
//
// An operator is told every event whole. That is the caller's to decide,
// since only it knows who is asking: the listener reads the role of a device's
// user and the web view the role of its visitor, both through EventFor, and
// the store reads it for each user a notification is written for (notify).
// The socket, `yardr events` and the agents read the event whole from the
// store; `yardr bead history` reads it as its actor through EventFor, as the
// bead's page does.
