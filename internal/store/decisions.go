// Decisions over the socket: a person's open asks as a queue, what they
// have dealt with, and one bead whole, for a program that is not yardr
// (footplate). docs/api.md promises these calls; the test of internal/rpc
// holds the page to the server.
//
// The queue is a new read of its own: every open ask addressed to the
// person, on the yard's beads in any stage and of any type, a crew
// journal's among them, oldest ask first. It is not yardr review's queue,
// which walks beads in manual stages by bead age and stays as it is.
//
// The writes delegate to AddAnswer, TakeBackAsk and AddNote: one
// implementation, not two. Every refusal is theirs, word for word. A secret ask is answered by
// GiveSecret (secretask.go), which the listener serves to a device of the
// operator and to nobody else. A run ask is approved by ApproveAsk
// (runask.go), which the listener serves likewise: a client reads the
// command and the yard's words for it here.
