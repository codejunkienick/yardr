// The carrying out of an approved apply (design yardr-bht9 3.5): an
// approval of a pack apply, of a source add that names commands, of a
// source rm whose command files are to go, of an up, or of a setup ask is
// recorded first (ApproveAsk and ApproveSetup,
// with the answer holding CarryPending) and carried out straight after
// by the yard's server, because applying a pack writes files and makes
// many store calls and cannot be one write of the store, and neither can
// writing a loose file's command files, starting the yard's processes,
// or a setup's account and grants.
//
// The store keeps, beside the ask, a carrying record the approval's
// write makes and only the server's methods move: approved and not yet
// taken, then claimed, with the claiming server's boot — a value the
// server mints at each start — and the time; then done, with the
// import's output, or failed, with its words. Claiming is one write, a
// claim of the claiming boot is never taken by another boot while the
// yard's one server runs, and a claim of an earlier boot is dead with
// that boot: the server that starts takes those up (ResumeCarry) before
// it serves, since the yard's socket is held by one server at a time.
// Completing and failing name the claiming boot and are refused under
// another, so a server that lost its claim — which means it stopped —
// cannot complete an ask its successor has taken. Done and failed are
// ends: neither is taken up again.
