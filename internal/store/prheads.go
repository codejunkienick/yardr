// records on its bead: the label merge-ok and the head commits a maintainer's
// yes, a reviewer, the yard's CI and a maintainer's acceptance wrote. The
// agent that reads a pull request's text is exactly the one a pull request
// would try to talk into writing them, so the checks here refuse a bead's
// agent (beadAgent) the writes that would make the yard trust a head nobody
// accepted, read, ran or merged, or post a review nobody wrote. Each runs
// inside UpdateBead's write, and the creation of a bead is refused them in
// checkAgentCreate.

// (the contributors pack's approved stage, merge-pr); metaMergeHead is the
// head commit a maintainer's yes recorded for it.
