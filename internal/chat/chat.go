// Package chat is the view behind yardr chat: the yard's residents, each
// with what its session is doing and how much of its mail is unread, the
// conversation with the selected one, and a line to write to it
// (docs/chat.md). Above the residents is the yard itself: the user's
// notifications, which are no conversation and take no answer (yard.go).
//
// It shows what the store keeps and sends through it: a conversation is
// store.API's Conversation, a line sent is its Mail, and what changes
// afterwards (mail, mail being read, a session starting, stopping or
// changing what it does) comes from the event stream (Follow), never from
// asking again in a loop. The model here knows no terminal: Update takes
// messages and View returns text, which is how it is tested.
//
// One thing is not the store's: the last lines of the pane of a resident
// that waits there for a person (Waits). They are read from the runtime,
// through Options.Tail, while such a resident is selected.
