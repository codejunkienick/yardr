// A question is answered from the view with AnswerKey (docs/chat.md): it
// replaces the line to type in with a field, in the place and the shape of
// the secret's (secret.go), and enter gives what was typed to the yard as
// yardr bead answer does: a pick with any words, words alone, or the
// approval of a run ask. The view adds no rule to the yard's, and shows what
// the yard refuses in the yard's words.
//
// What is typed in the line for mail stays mail, a bare number included: a
// mail can be "1", and an answer is a deliberate act, so nothing in the line
// is ever read as one. Putting an ask aside and declining it are flags of the
// command and no card's answers, so they stay there; a secret has SecretKey;
// and a setup ask takes its account with the pick, which is typed in a
// terminal.

// AnswerStore is what answering an ask takes of the yard. It is not part of
// Store, as SecretStore is not: ApproveAsk is the operator's alone to make
// (docs/api.md, rpc.OperatorCalls), and a view that was given no AnswerStore
// leaves every ask to the terminal, as its card then says. AnswerAsk is a
// pick or words, and ApproveAsk the approval of a run ask, which AnswerAsk
// refuses: the two calls yardr bead answer makes, on the yard's own socket.
