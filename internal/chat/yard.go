// conversation. It is a row and no third column, since a row folds into the
// line of a narrow terminal with the residents, is reached with the key
// that reaches them, and costs the conversation no width.
//
// It differs from a resident's row in what it is not: it has no state, no
// pane, and no line to type in, since nobody sent a notification and nobody
// reads an answer. Its unread count is of notifications only, and a
// resident's of that resident's mail only. Opening it acknowledges the
// notifications (AckUserNotifications) and leaves the mail's position
// where it is.
