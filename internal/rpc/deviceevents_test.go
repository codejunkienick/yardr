// A kind of event that has no row in the store's table of what a person who
// is not the operator is told (store.EventDataToldKinds) tells that person no
// data, which is safe and silent: its author never decided what it tells. So
// every kind the code writes must have a row, and this test is where one that
// has none is found. It reads the source of internal/ for the writers of
// events (the store's event, LogEvent and LogDispatch), takes their kinds from
// the strings and the constants they are given, and adds what no scan of the
// source can read: the kinds a variable carries (variableSites, by hand, and
// counted so that a new site fails until it is listed) and the kinds
// LogDispatch accepts (store.DispatchKinds).
//
// The gate runs this test on any change under internal/: the reads table of
// .yardr/test has the row (internal/ -> internal/rpc). It must, since rpc
// imports only the store: a change to a writer in another package (dispatch,
// server, cli) selects that package and its importers, none of which is rpc,
// and the kinds it writes would land with no row decided.
