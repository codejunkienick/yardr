// ClientHeader is where a program that is not yardr says what it is

// Calls are the methods a program that is not yardr may rely on, each with
// the names its arguments have in a request that gives them by name:
// docs/api.md is the contract, and the test of this file holds the two
// together. They are what a chat client needs, yardr chat among them: its
// view (chat.Store) and the command that opens it; what a client that
// shows a person's decisions needs (UserAsks, Waiting for the beads parked
// in their stages, Bead and the writes, MoveBead among them); and
// what a client that shows a kept hook delivery's files needs (DeliveryFiles,
// with the hook_files event to read it again on; the bytes are the blob
// route's); and what a device paired before the channel needs to seal its
// calls (RegisterChannelKey, served on the listener alone: listenerOnly).
// Every other method is yardr's own, changes with its builds,
// and takes its arguments as yardr sends them, in an array.
//
// A name here is on the wire for good. An argument a later build adds is
// one a client of today leaves out, so it must mean what the call did
// before when it is the zero value.
//
// AnswerAskExpected, DeferAskExpected and DeclineAskExpected are the three
// writes of a decision guarded by the ask's turn, which a client read in
// UserAsks or Bead. A new name, not a new argument of the old three: a yard
// from before them answers a call of one as a method it does not have, and
// the old three refuse a turn by name or a further argument in an array, so
// no yard takes a guarded answer as an unguarded one. On a mapping card the
// pick and the decline are guarded by the held count read too.

// OperatorCalls are documented as Calls are, and are an operator's alone
// to make. The socket serves them to whoever the store lets make them; the
// listener serves them to a device of an operator (a user whose role is
// store.RoleOperator) and answers every
// other caller as it answers a method the yard does not have
// (UserServer.operatorCall). GiveSecret carries a secret a person typed, on
// its way to the file a source's credential is read from: it crosses a
// network only from the operator's own device, under the TLS in front of
// the listener and no other protection, and never a link to another yard.
// One giving is not the operator's alone: a secret ask for a user's own
// address or credential in a source is that user's to answer too, and the
// listener serves it to a device of theirs (UserServer.ownSecret).
//
// ApproveAsk approves a run ask, and the yard then runs the one command the
// ask holds, as the operator (design yardr-x3g8, section 3.6). It is the
// first call here that causes an operator's command, and what it can cause
// is the store's fixed list (store.ApproveAsk) and nothing else. It is the
// operator's device's and no other's: a run ask for a user's own
// subscription, which that user approves on the socket, is not served to a
// device of theirs.
//
// ApproveSetup approves a setup ask with the preset pick and the account
// together, and the yard then applies the pack, takes the account, and
// grants the preset picked, as the operator (design yardr-7d4e, section
// 3.6). Like GiveSecret it carries a secret a person typed, on its way to
// the file a source's credential is read from, or the candidate taken
// instead, or on an update nothing: the account that stands is kept. Like
// ApproveAsk it is the operator's device's and no other's. Down the link from
// the edge the account typed is a secret as GiveSecret's is: a hosted yard
// takes it, and any other refuses it, but takes the other two
// (UserServer.call).
//
// Each of the three, and AnswerAsk for a pick on a mapping ask, takes the
// argument weighed: the client's word that its person saw the weight of a
// weighty card before approving it (design yardr-ekmx 3.3). The yard
// refuses a weighty card without it and checks nothing more, so it is the
// client's gate that stands behind the word. A client from before it leaves
// it out, and a routine card asks for none.
//
// SourceGrants reads every grant of the yard's sources: who may call what
// (each call with its kind, so that a client without the sources' files tells
// a read from an update), as whom, and each call's own when, by whom and on
// which card (design yardr-ekmx 3.4). It changes nothing and carries no
// secret, but the whole grant graph is the operator's to read, so it is here
// and not in Calls.
//
// SessionScreen reads what a running session's pane shows: its visible
// screen with the ANSI styling, so the operator sees whether something
// hangs. It changes nothing, but a screen can show what an agent printed,
// a secret among it, so it is the operator's to read and no one else's.
//
// Teammates reads the yard's teammates: one row per address of the
// standing web_jwt_users mapping, each with its yard user name, role,
// email, who invited them and when, and their devices with last use. A
// row with devices is paired; a row without is waiting. Whether anyone
// signed in over the edge's web door is not told: nothing at the yard
// records it. It is the operator's to read: on the socket it is a read,
// served as every read of the store is to a caller on the yard's
// machine, and on the listener it is there for a device of the operator
// and for no other caller, since the mapping is theirs. It changes
// nothing, but the operator's device token goes with the request, so the
// listener takes it only over https or from the yard's own machine, like
// the other calls of this list, and down the link from the edge from a
// paired device of the operator, as an approval.
//
// UninviteTeammate files the removal of a teammate: the run ask
// `user uninvite <user>` on a new bead, addressed to the yard's
// operator, as AskNew files it. It files the ask and no more: approval,
// the edge-first removal and the retry are the card's built path, and
// approving from the same device uses ApproveAsk. It refuses a user the
// yard has not, one no mapping names, and the caller's own user. On the
// socket it files as its actor, as AskNew does; on the listener it is
// there for a device of the operator and for no other caller. The
// operator's device token goes with the request, so the listener takes
// it only over https or from the yard's own machine, like the other
// calls of this list, and down the link from the edge from a paired
// device of the operator, as an approval.
//
// TelemetryShow reads what yardr telemetry show prints: the switch, the
// install id with its pseudonymous sentence, and the next request or why
// there is none. It changes nothing, but the id groups the yard's events
// across time, so it is the operator's to read and no one else's: its
// socket class is Operator, and the listener serves it to an operator's
// device alone.
// TelemetrySet turns the switch on or off through the CLI's own
// functions, so consent bookkeeping is the same however it is turned. It
// is the operator's to change, and this device call is never served down
// the yard link from the edge. A hosted customer without a terminal uses
// the web view's control through its separate web link, where the view
// verifies the gateway's JWT and maps it to a yard user.
//
// DevicePairOpen opens a pairing for one device of one user, as `yardr
// user device pair` does, and answers its code and expiry;
// DevicePairState reads the open pairing back with its code and QR
// string, so a reopened window shows the same pairing again; and
// DevicePairClose ends it, as `yardr user device pair --end` does. The
// three are the socket's alone: a device token never opens a pairing, so
// the listener serves them to no device, not even the operator's, and
// answers each as a method the yard does not have, down the yard link
// from the edge alike (UserServer.operatorCall).
