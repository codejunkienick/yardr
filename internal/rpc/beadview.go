// bead is Bead as a device is told it: the view the store gives, but for
// the file of a setup card's typed account, the candidates of the card, each
// a file of the yard's with the values it holds, and for the file the account
// of an approved setup is set in, which is the candidate's when the approval
// took one: only a device of the operator is told them (isOperator, as
// store.DeviceTold tells the operator's words). To any other device the card reads
// as one with none and naming no file
// (store.SetupAsked.WithoutCandidatesAndFile) and what the setup printed says
// the account is set and not where, or that it failed and no more, since the
// words of a failure name the file too (store.SetupAsked.WithoutAccountFile),
// and in a yard without an operator it does to every device. A run ask is told
// as its asker typed it, and not as the yard wrote it up from its own records:
// what the command changes and takes back, the files it carries, the plan of a
// pack, and what it printed when approved, which name the files and the
// settings it is about (withoutRunWords). Where the typed words themselves
// carry a value or a path, argv and command are told to the operator alone,
// and the ask reads as its question and the command's help line. The socket,
// the terminal and the
// agents read the whole card and result from the store, as they do the
// operator's words. UserAsks holds the same back from the same devices
// (userAsks), since the user an ask was put to need not be the operator now.
// The yard's own words about a failed fetch or login are held likewise: a
// note by the yard that a peer's branch could not be taken, or that a note
// from another yard met a flow that does not read, reads as what happened,
// that the bead is held, and that why is an operator's to read, and the
// words of a login ask taken back when the login ended read as that the
// login ended and that why is an operator's to read
// (store.HeldYardNote, store.HeldYardWords). Any other note and any other
// words read as they are.
