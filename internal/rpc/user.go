//
// It is docs/api.md over TCP with one header more, `Authorization: Bearer
// <credential>`, and the same implementation serves both (api). What makes
// it fit to stand on a port that may face the internet:
//
//   - only the calls of Calls, by name: every other method of the store, and
//     the array form yardr's own builds use, is answered as not there. The
//     calls more are nine of OperatorCalls, GiveSecret, ApproveAsk,
//     ApproveSetup, SourceGrants, SessionScreen, Teammates,
//     UninviteTeammate, TelemetryShow and TelemetrySet, for a device of
//     an operator, and not there for anyone else (operatorCall), but
//     GiveSecret for a device of a user whose own address or credential
//     in a source is asked for (ownSecret). The other three of
//     OperatorCalls, DevicePairOpen, DevicePairState and DevicePairClose,
//     are the socket's alone and are not there for any device, an
//     operator's included: a device token never opens a pairing
//     (socketOnly);
//   - every call is made as the user the credential resolves to (asUser);
//   - Settings answers the keys of the store's device settings and no
//     other, and the stream carries the value of a setting_changed for
//     those alone (store.DeviceTold), so a lost token gives away no
//     address or secret that the yard keeps in another setting;
//   - Bead and UserAsks tell the file of a setup card's typed account, the
//     candidates of the card, the yard's other accounts by file and the values
//     they hold, and the file the account of an approved setup is set in, to a
//     device of an operator alone (bead, userAsks), and the stream tells the
//     file a source_set points a source
//     at and the command that mints its token, the file a user_set points a
//     user at, the files a user_removed says a removed user's login named,
//     and the secret file a hook_blocked names, to one alone
//     (deviceEvent), so a lost token of another user, or of one who was the
//     operator, gives away no address or file of an account the yard keeps;
//   - the stream is told by an allow-list: each kind of event has a row of the
//     keys of its data a device that is no operator's is told, and every
//     other key is held, as is every key of a kind that has no row
//     (store.Event.WithoutHeld), so that a kind written later tells no data
//     until its author lists it, and a lost token gives away no handle, path,
//     command or error that names one from any event. Flows says that a
//     depot's flows could not be read and not why (flows), Peers has no address
//     and no error text (peers), DeliveryFiles says that a file was not taken
//     and not why (deliveryFiles), GiveSecret says which names a device's own
//     giving wrote and not the file, and refuses a value the file cannot hold
//     without naming it (giveSecret), a run ask is told as its asker typed it
//     but for the typed words that carry a value or a path, which are the
//     operator's alone (withoutRunWords), a call that fails on the yard's
//     own file says that it failed and not on which file (shapeUserErr),
//     and the rows of the notifications are made by the store from what
//     their person is told of the event (store.Event.WithoutHeld);
//   - Users, GetUser, Crew and GetCrew tell the file a user's address is read
//     from, and of a crew member the directory it runs in, the files and
//     commands its config names and the handles of its sessions, to a device
//     of an operator alone (users, crew), so that these calls give a lost
//     token of another user no file or command of a user or a crew member;
//   - who is an operator is the user's role (store.RoleOperator), read at
//     each call (isOperator), not the operator setting, which names only
//     whom an ask with no --to goes to;
//   - the stream carries a mail, a read receipt and a reaction only to a
//     device of its sender or its receiver (deviceEvent), and a blob only
//     to one that may read it; one the yard cannot read is told without
//     the file (userBlob). A lost token gives away no mail but its
//     user's own;
//   - without a credential that resolves every path is 401, answered before
//     the body is read or anything of the yard but the credential's record;
//     a lookup that did not answer in time is 503 with Retry-After, since
//     it says nothing about the credential and the device should keep asking;
//   - a refusal is counted by its reason and logged in sums (refuse), and
//     nothing is kept for the address it came from or for the credential, so
//     no number of them shuts out or slows a device at that address;
//   - with no device in the yard the paths are not there: 404.

// from one whose proxy says it came in plain (X-Forwarded-Proto, read for a

// can see of the client's rule, "https, or loopback" (docs/api.md), and no
// more than that: a proxy on this machine that takes plain HTTP from
// outside and does not say so is not seen.
//
// A hosted yard's router is the one peer besides this machine a secret is
// taken from: the address the setting names, saying the request came to it
// over https (fromRouter). An approval is not taken from it: from the
// router's peer ApproveAsk and ApproveSetup are refused as from anywhere
// else, whatever the setting names.
//
// An approval holds no secret of its own, but for the account a setup's
// approval may type (ApproveSetup's values), which is a giving's. It is held
// to the same rule for what it does: a token read off a network in the clear
// would otherwise have the operator's commands run from wherever it was read.
//
// The refusal comes after the request has crossed, so it says that too.
//
// Over the link from the edge the listener's reason does not hold: the
// request came down the link. Which secrets cross is the yard's to say, and
// only call can say it, since the ask, or the account typed, is in the body:
// crosses is its word that this giving, or this setup approval with the
// account typed, is one the yard takes down the link, and it passes false
// for every call it judges before the body is read. hosted is the yard's
// hosted setting, read the same way: on
// a hosted yard the operator's giving crosses, so a giving refused down the
// link is a member's own, and its refusal names the operator's paired
// device as the fix. On a hosted yard every secret crosses, for a device of the
// operator: the hosting service runs the edge and the machine the yard lives
// on, so a refusal would guard nothing it does not hold, and would leave a
// person with no shell on that machine unable to give a key at all (hosted).
// On a yard connected to the edge from the person's own machine one giving
// crosses, the code a harness's sign-in page shows (loginCode), which is used
// once, within minutes, and kept nowhere: the refusal of every other names
// that reason, answers on the yard's own machine as the fix, and says the
// edge saw what this one carried, so the key is remade. A setup approval
// that types the account is such a giving and is refused the same way; one
// that takes a candidate or keeps the account holds no secret and crosses.
// An approval crosses on either: a paired device of the operator is the
// operator (design yardr-xpf8), pairing is the grant and `yardr user device
// rm` is the revoke, and the command an approval runs is fixed on the ask. A
// session's screen crosses to the same device: pairing is the grant there
// too, and a member's device is answered as for a method the yard does not
// have (operatorCall). The teammates list and a teammate's removal filing cross
// to the same device: a hosted yard's teammates are read and removed from
// the operator's paired device. The edge sees the device's token with
// each, and what an approval or a giving writes says it came by the edge
// (call). If the edge says the device reached it over plain HTTP, the
