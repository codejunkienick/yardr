// yard's enrolment at POST /edge/enrol (answering a code, and the account's
// handle with the yard's name once a person has approved the yard),
// drops a yard's row at POST /edge/disconnect, mints a Google access
// token at POST /mint/google, takes a yard's preview reports at POST
// /preview/report (answering the id it issued the preview and its host),
// and serves the link at GET /edge/link (edgelink.go). A request is
// checked as a peer's is, signed by the yard whose key it names, to this
// edge's key, within yardkey.MaxSkew; every answer is signed with the key
