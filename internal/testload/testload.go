// Package testload sizes the waits of a test to the machine it runs on. A
// fuse against a hang, or the deadline of a poll, is written for an idle box;
// Scale makes the wait as many times longer as the machine is loaded, by the
// larger of two factors: the one the gate gives the race leg (YARDR_TEST_LOAD),
// read as the leg started, and the machine's own, read as the wait is armed. A
// leg that starts on a quiet box and meets a load of fifty on the way is sized
// by the second, and so is a run the gate gave no factor. A wait that is met
// returns early, so only a red test burns the whole of a scaled one: the factor
// costs a green run nothing. What a test measures does not go through here: a
// deadline that is an input of the program under test is the test's to set, and
// the pause between two looks is no fuse. Loaded is the same factor read as a
// verdict, for the rare test that must tell a slow machine from a slow program.
//
// What else the suites share is the git they run: PreferRealGit makes it git
// itself, where macOS would put its shim in front; and what a process they
// killed counts as: Running and GroupRunning count a zombie as dead, as a wait
// for a killed process must where nothing reaps it.
