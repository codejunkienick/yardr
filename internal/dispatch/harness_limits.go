// A harness that stopped on a usage limit says so, and seldom says which
// window or until when in a line the yard can read: on 6 Oct 2026 the
// yardmaster guessed 02:13 for a crew member whose window opened at 00:02
// (yardr-m71s). A source of the yard that says limits knows (see
// internal/limits). So a session_harness_error of reason rate_limited, a
// session's or a crew member's, carries what that source says of the
// harness's kind: the report, and the window the agent waits for with when
// it resets.
//
// The source's command is slow, may be bounded in how often it answers and
// may renew a stored login as it reads one, so it is not leaned on. The
// dispatcher reads it in three places, and runs it in none of them:
// harnessLimits is reached only while such an event is being raised, once
// per idle spell of a session and once per standing error of a crew
// member; windowOpen (harness_reset.go) only when the reset such an event
// told of has come and the agent is about to be prompted; routeQuota
// (quota.go) only for a ready bead whose route is gated (store.Route.Gated:
// it puts a quota condition on a group, or names a group that starts
// agents), with the longer age routeLimitsMemory, since a start is no
// emergency and beads become ready far more often than a harness stops.
// Every read is of the memory below, kept fresh by the background
// refresher (limits_refresh.go): a command that hangs holds no pass at
// all, and agents that stop or wake together are still one run. A route
// reads one thing of it past the age: the report the provider last gave
// (limitRead.last), whole while it is young and its used-up windows
// after that (unknownQuota), however many runs have failed since.

// limitsMemory is how long what a provider said is kept, in the memory of
// this daemon only: five sessions of one kind that stop in the same minute
// are one ask. An answer is the provider's, not the kind's, read under one
// login, so the memory is by the name the source's file gives the provider
// and whose login was read.
