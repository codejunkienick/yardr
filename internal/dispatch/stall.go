// A session whose agent never got going: it was given its first prompt, was
// idle every time the dispatcher looked since, and has left nothing behind
// (no note, no commit, no change in its worktree). That is what an agent
// looks like whose first request was refused: a model it may not use, no
// login, no credit. Its TUI starts, the error shows in its pane, and it
// sits idle. Waiting for the idle limit (30m) would hold the bead, the
// group's slot and every bead after it meanwhile, so it is reported as
// session_stalled as soon as it has been idle for the group's `stall`
// (default 2m; "off" or "0" turns it off), with the pane's last lines.
//
// Until the stalled session is ended (`yardr bead release`), gets going
// after all, or the group's model changes, the group starts no further
// session with the same model: each would stall the same way. (A session
// that waits for the window of a usage limit holds its group back likewise:
// see holdBack.)
