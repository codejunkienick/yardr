// RunCall answers the call name of d, which names run in place of a request,
// with the command it names, run from its installed copy under home: a
// service no request reaches has its program carried by the declaration, as a
// build's is, and the yard sends nothing to it. The command is handed the
// typed parameters as {"params": ...}, the credential under the variable the
// call's kind uses and the declaration's base, as BuildBody's is, and prints
// one JSON object of at most MaxCommandOutput bytes within Timeout. That
// object, after the call's select and held to its answer.max as an HTTP
// answer is, is the answer, under a status of 200. What the command reaches
// it reaches itself, with the credential it was handed.
//
// A non-zero exit is the command's refusal, a CallError of RunRefused that
// says its last stderr lines; whatever else keeps it from one bounded object
// (no program, no answer in time, too much, no object) is one of RunFailed.
// Neither holds what the command printed on stdout, and the credential's
// literal value is cut from what they say. readSecret is Do's.
