//     that user. It is the one place the port reaches the store API: those

//     credential (rpc.UserServer). A device of the operator is served
//     the operator's calls besides (rpc.OperatorCalls), a device of
//     another user GiveSecret for their own address in a source alone, and
//     nobody else either. A yard with no device answers 404 there.
