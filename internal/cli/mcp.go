		Use:   "mcp [--connection <name>]",
		Short: "Serve the yard to your own MCP client on this machine, over stdio",
		Long: `Runs an MCP server on the standard input and output your MCP client
started this process with, so that client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop,
or any other MCP client) works the yard as you: what is happening with
your work, filing a request, rewording or withdrawing a request you
filed, the questions waiting for you and your answers to them, writing
to the yardmaster, reading your mail, and answering one message by
number with mail to its sender. It is one more window like
the browser view and yardr chat: every call is made as the one user
named below, and the yard's own rules decide each one.

Who it acts as is who this run acts as, resolved as every yardr
command resolves it: --actor where that flag is given, else
$YARDR_ACTOR, else your login name, looked up as a person of the yard.
Where that names no person of the yard, the server runs and its tools
are listed, but every tool refuses with the reason and the way on, and
no tool is served until one resolves.

--connection names this client, once, in its configuration (for
example --connection openclaw): the name goes on every call, and the
yard's history marks what this client writes as you via that name
("ada via openclaw"), as it marks a device's writes. It is a label,
taken on trust with nothing behind it, since whoever can run this
command on this machine already acts as you; it cannot be revoked,
and stopping this client is stopping the program. Without a name,
writes read as you alone.

One thing is never done here, on any connection: a secret is never
given through MCP. A question that asks for one is refused in plain
words naming where it is given instead (the yard's browser view, or
yardr bead answer in a terminal here), and the question stays open.

Built on the official Go SDK for MCP (the modelcontextprotocol
go-sdk). It speaks MCP 2025-06-18 or later: the modern
revision 2026-07-28 (no handshake, the version on each request) and
the legacy revisions 2025-06-18 and 2025-11-25 (a handshake, then
its session). ` + mcp.FloorMessage,
