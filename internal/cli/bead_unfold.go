		Use:   "unfold <carrier> <member> --reason <reason|-> [--to <stage>]",
		Short: "Take a bead out of the carrier it was folded into",
		Long: `Takes the member out of the carrier, restored whole: it reopens in --to
(the flow's first stage without it) with the reason as a note, and what the
fold moved from it comes back: its tracking links, the beads it blocked
(with the stages the edges named) and whoever watched it. A target two
parts moved stays on the carrier until the last of them is out, so each
part restores exactly what it moved. The folded edge is gone, the carrier's
body gains the taken-out line, and an unfolded event is logged on it.

--reason - reads the reason from stdin: write one that quotes code or file
names as a heredoc with a quoted delimiter, since inside a double-quoted
argument the shell runs every backtick span and $( ) and puts what it prints
in the reason. A --reason - with no words on stdin is refused, and the part
stays folded.

Each part of a carrier is its own commit, starting with the part's bead id,
so taking the part out of the bead leaves taking it out of the branch: revert
its commit on the carrier's branch and go on reviewing. A bead that is not a
member of the carrier is refused, as are an open member, a closed carrier and
a --to outside the member's flow. --json prints the member, with the carrier
it came out of.`,
