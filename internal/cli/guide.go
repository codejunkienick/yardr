		Long: `Print the setup steps, each done or todo, and take the first one not done as
a form. The steps are the ones yardr doctor lists, read from the store: the
setup goes on where the yard stands, whoever did the earlier steps (this
form, the mayor in its pane, a person on the command line), and can be run
again at any time.

Every page ends in a command that exists, and shows its command line before
it runs:

  a rig                 the repository and its base branch: yardr rig add
  the rig's files       yardr rig init, which writes starter roles, a gate
                        and a flow under .yardr/; then it asks before it
                        commits them on the base branch
  builders, reviewers   the form of yardr group add, starting at a group on
                        the yard's default harness with the role's prompt
  landing               a refinery (yardr's merge-local, installed in
                        <home>/scripts/, as an exec group) or people who
                        merge by hand (a manual group, routed for approved)
  routes                new, review and approved, each to the group that
                        does its work: shown, confirmed, yardr route add
  a first bead          its title and goal: yardr bead create, then
                        yardr bead advance --to new; and how to watch it

After each page it asks how to go on: keep going here, talk to the mayor
(opens yardr chat on the mayor in this terminal; the mayor goes on from the
same steps), or stop here. With --no-chat that choice prints where the
mayor's pane is and brings it to the front instead. When the mayor is not
running it opens nothing and prints what yardr doctor says of it. A page that is cancelled (ctrl+c, or
no at its last question) has run no command: the yard is as the finished
pages made it. The one exception is the rig's files, which yardr rig init
has written into the checkout before the question whether to commit them;
they stay there, and rig init never overwrites a file.

Where the forms end it asks a user whether to be told when beads land: a
yes is yardr subscribe <you> yardr --done --where rig=<rig>, and each bead
of the rig that is done is then a notification in your inbox (yardr inbox).
