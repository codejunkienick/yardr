// A preview is a program the yard's crew built, run in the yard under
// its supervisor and opened by the yard's person through the edge.
// The records are the store's; the supervisor, part of yardr server,
// does the running.
// This file is the crew's face: propose, watch, list, stop, logs and
// forget. Start and restart have no crew command: a start is the
// person's approval or Start, the supervisor's crash restart, or the
// on-demand start when its person visits. A watch is the one start a
// crew member makes, because it runs nothing of theirs: the supervisor
// serves files.

open through the edge. A crew member proposes one with its start
command, directory and loopback port; the yard records the depot
commit it read itself, and nothing runs until the yard's person
approves the card (in the web view, a later bead). The supervisor in
yardr server then starts the approved command, captures its output
to ~/.yardr/previews/<app>.log, restarts a crash with backoff, and
stops it after preview_idle without a request (four hours while
unset) or seven days running. An approval is for the commit and dirty
mark its card showed: a start or restart on a tree that reads
otherwise takes the approval back, and the card waits pending for a
new one.

A watch is a preview of another kind, for a site being built: the yard
itself serves the files of a directory of a bead's worktree, read-only,
and the page reloads when a file changes. It runs no command, so there
is nothing to approve. It is plain files only: a site that needs a build
step is an app, proposed as above.`}
