		Long: `Connects this yard to the edge at <url>, such as https://my.yardr.dev, which
then takes this yard's webhooks and hands them to it.

The first step is trust. The command fetches the edge's key over HTTPS (plain
http only to this machine, for a stand-in), prints it and pins it. Whoever
holds a valid certificate for the address at that moment is taken for the
edge. After that the pin holds on its own: a different certificate, a
different machine behind the name, or a different key served later moves
nothing. To check the key, compare it with the one published at
` + publishedKeyAt + `.

Then the yard enrols. It sends its public key and the name it proposes for
itself at the edge, signed to the edge's key, and gets a code back. Open
<url>/connect, sign in to your account there and enter the code. The page
shows this yard's proposed name and the start of its key before you approve
it, and you may change the name there; what the edge answers back is kept.
You type and paste nothing on this machine: the yard's key is its credential,
and every answer from the edge is checked against the pinned key. The
proposal is the yard's own name, or --as <name> to choose another, in lower
case letters, digits and '-'.

Connecting sets the edge setting, and sets hook_public_url to
<url>/hooks/<account>/<yard>, where the edge takes this yard's webhooks, so
hooks print and register the right URL. A hook_public_url you had set is kept
inside the edge setting, and yardr edge disconnect puts it back.

A yard connects to one edge at a time: run yardr edge disconnect before
connecting again. Only the operator connects a yard. With --json the command

		Use: "setup-google <edge-url>", Short: "Set the hosted mint on the granted google sources, and record the provider's terms",
		Long: `Sets the hosted mint on this yard's google sources, for a yard whose
Google is connected at the edge: each of google-drive, google-docs,
google-slides and google-calendar is probed once through the edge, and
only a source whose scopes the connection was granted gets
mint_command="yardr edge mint-google <edge-url> <source>". That line is
read by the yard's server as the hosted mint, which it mints in-process
for a source call; running the command itself mints nothing, for any
caller. A source the
probe refuses keeps the pack's google-mint, and its token is discarded.
google-mail is untouched: it mints locally in this slice. Clearing a
source's mint_command (yardr source set <source> mint_command=) is the
way back to the pack's mint. Only the operator sets a mint, as only the
operator sets any source's.

The same setup records what you read of your model provider's terms.
It names the provider of the yard's harness kind (default_kind) and
asks you to read that provider's terms page. With --terms-read you say
you read it: --terms-url names the page you relied on, --read-on the
date (today by default), and --bars-general-training says those terms
bar creating, training or improving a general model from the data.
Without --terms-read no record is made.`,
		Example: `  yardr edge setup-google https://my.yardr.dev --terms-read --terms-url https://provider.example/terms --bars-general-training`,
		Args:    cobra.ExactArgs(1),
