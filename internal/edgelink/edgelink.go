// Package edgelink is the yard's side of the edge: the service at
// https://my.yardr.dev that stands in front of yards. It holds what yardr
// edge connect does: fetch the edge's key, enrol this yard by a code a
// person approves in a browser, and ask the edge to forget the yard again;
// and the link the server keeps open to
// the edge once the yard is connected (Link, link.go). The edge's half is the router of the
// yardr-hosted repository; this package is its client and knows no more of
// it than the calls below.
//
// The yard has no key of the edge's until it has fetched one, and a request
// is signed to a named receiver key (yardkey.SignRequest), so the first
// step is the one that is not signed: GET /edge/key over HTTPS. That is
// trust on first use, as ssh has for a host key, with the web's
// certificates making the first use hard to intercept. Everything after it
// is signed with the yard's key and answered signed with the key that was
// fetched, so a different key at the same address, later, moves nothing.
//
// The calls, all under the edge's origin:
//
//	GET  /edge/key        the edge's public key as store.Public writes it,
//	                      as plain text. Not signed.
//	POST /edge/enrol      {"key": <the yard's key>, "enc": <its encryption
//	                      key>, "name": <its name>}. The encryption key is
//	                      presented beside the signing key since the sealed
//	                      peer wire, so the edge can publish both (design
//	                      yardr-4687 §3.5); an edge from before it ignores it.
//	                      Answered {"code", "expires"} (RFC 3339, shown to
//	                      the person and read as unknown if it is anything
//	                      else) while no one has
//	                      approved the yard at the edge's /connect page, and
//	                      {"handle", "name", "email"} once someone has: the
//	                      account's handle, this yard's name among its yards
//	                      (the person may have changed the proposal at the
//	                      page), and who approved. The yard
//	                      calls again, signed anew, until the second, and is
//	                      answered the same code while its code is open.
//	POST /edge/disconnect {}: the edge forgets the row that names the yard's
//	                      key, and answers 200, or 404 if it had none.
//	POST /mint/google {"account": <the Google account's address>}:
//	                      Answered {"token", "expires_at",
//	                      "granted_scopes"}: the access token, when it
//	                      expires, and the scopes the connection was
//	                      granted, which the yard checks its source
//	                      against before it prints the token.
//	POST /member/add    {"yard_handle", "yard_name", "email",
//	                      "yard_user", "invited_by", "yard_key"}: the
//	                      yard reports an approved invite; 200 lands it,
//	                      a signed 403/409/422 refuses it for good, and
//	                      a signed 503 (or no answer) leaves it owed.
//	POST /member/remove {"yard_handle", "yard_name", "email",
//	                      "yard_key"}: the yard reports an approved
//	                      removal; 200 lands it, 404 lands it too (the
//	                      edge holds no such membership), a signed
//	                      403/409/422 refuses it for good, and a signed
//	                      503 (or no answer) leaves it owed. The router
//	                      sets who reports from the signing key, so no
//	                      body field names the reporter.
//	POST /preview/report {"app", "port", "kind", "state"}: the yard
//	                      reports one of its previews. An app has no kind
//	                      and the port it binds; a watch has kind "watch"
//	                      and port 0, since it binds none. The state is
//	                      the yard's own (approved, running, stopped), or
//	                      "forgotten" for a preview the yard has dropped.
//	                      Answered {"status", "preview_id", "host"}: the id
//	                      the edge issued the preview and the host it is
//	                      opened at, which a state the edge keeps no
//	                      address for leaves out. A signed 4xx but 429
//	                      refuses the report in {"refused"}'s words, and a
//	                      signed 429 or 5xx (or no answer) leaves it owed.
//
// A request carries the yard's key, the time and the signature in the
// Yardr-Peer-* headers, as between peers. An answer carries its signature
// in Yardr-Peer-Signature, made with the edge's key over its status, the
// request's signature and its body (store.SignResponse). An answer that
// is not so signed is anyone's, whatever it says. A refusal is a 4xx with
// {"refused": <reason>}, signed too.
//
// The edge answers each signature once. A request is stamped in whole
// seconds, so two identical calls made in the same second are one signature,
// and the second is refused before the edge acts on it: 401 with
// X-Edge-Refusal: replay and no signature, since whoever sends a signature
// twice is not proved to be the yard. The yard signs the call again a second
// on and makes it once more (Client.call).
