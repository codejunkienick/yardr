// bead page approves run and setup cards, weight first with the yard's
// sentences, and a strong card — trust or code in its stored weight — is
// approved only under a fresh sign-in. Approving one starts the gateway
// re-authentication unless the session's last authentication was a
// strong-card re-authentication by this operator inside the window,
// whichever strong card started it; a standing login, however recent,
// never counts. The return state is one-use and bound to its card,
// consumed only for it, and the store takes the approval only with the
// request's fresh witness. Anywhere but the hosted web a strong card
// stays terminal-only.
