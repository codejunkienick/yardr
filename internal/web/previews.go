// Previews is the Previews page: one card per preview of the yard, as
// `yardr preview list` has them, with what the card approves: the start
// command in full, the directory, the port, the depot commit and dirty
// mark, the proposer and the lifetime, the running preview's log tail,
// and a stale mark when the depot HEAD has moved past the running
// commit. The command and the log are the operator's to read; any other
// reader gets the card without them. A watch has a card of its own kind
// while it runs, with the bead, directory and lifetime, and Open and Stop:
// it has no command or commit to approve, and a watch that ended leaves
// the page, where a card that waits for a person must stand out. A card
// shows the host the edge gave the preview as its address once it has
// one, and Open goes there: the view serves nothing at the yard-side
// /preview/<app>/ the edge forwards to, so a card with no host has no
// Open and says why.
