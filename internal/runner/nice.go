// A group's nice setting (store.Group.Nice) is the niceness its sessions run
// at: the higher it is, the more a session gives way to what has a lower one,
// such as the daemon, when every core is wanted. A process inherits the
// niceness of the one that starts it, so the session's own process is all
// that is set, before it starts anything: an exec group's command is run
// under nice (underNice), and the shell of a herdr group's pane is reniced
// before the agent is started in it (niceShell). A process without privilege
// can only raise its niceness, so a session never runs at a lower one than
// the process that starts it: asked for less than that, it is left as it is.

// niceOf is the niceness of the process pid. The Linux system call answers 20
// less than the niceness, so that none of its answers is negative; the
// others answer the niceness.

// own, and for a want of 0: a group that asks for none starts as it would

// would keep the niceness they began with. nice execs the command, so the pid
