// Usage is what the agent of handle's session used, read from its own session
// file by the entries of its kind's usage (store.UsageSource), once the
// session has ended. The kind is the handle's own (harnessKind) and the file is
// named by the session id the dispatcher kept on it (agent_session): herdr is
// not asked, since it no longer knows an agent whose tab is closed. With no id
// kept, a kind that declares a workspace is matched by its worktree instead
// (matchWorkspace): the one file that qualifies is read as a kept id would
// be, two or more read missing "ambiguous match", and none reads missing
// "no session id", as a kind without a match does.
//
// The first entry is the harness's own total, and the ones after it are
// fallbacks that fall short of it. Without fallback only the first is tried,
// and a file with no line for it yet is dispatch.ErrUsageNotYet, so the caller
// can wait: the total may be written a moment after the session ended. With
// fallback the first entry that finds a line is the reading, and a file that
// has none for any entry is missing "no usage line". partial is that entry's
// own: what it read falls short of what the session used.
//
// handle.count_due.until is set for a session whose agent was left running for
// inspection. Usage then counts only the lines written at or before it, so what
// a person does in the pane afterwards is not the bead's, however late the read
// is. An entry that names no time for its lines is left out, since it could
// hold work after the cutoff (Claude's cost-state is written when the process
// exits, however long after), and so is a line whose time does not read. A
// caller reads such a session once until has passed: lines at or before it may
// still be coming until then.
//
// err is for what the caller tries again on a later pass: the file could not
// be read, or dispatch.ErrUsageNotYet. missing is for what it records: why no
// count is there and none will come. Otherwise u is the count.
