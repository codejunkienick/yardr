// FS holds each embedded pack as a directory of its name: starter/pack.yaml
// and the files it names. starter is written for a depot that is a git
// repository, dir for one that is a plain directory. contributors is for a
// git depot too, beside the flow the depot follows: what comes to its
// repository from outside, an issue or a pull request, as a bead. design is
// beside the depot's flow too: the lane a bead of type design takes, from a
// drafted document to a decision. ci-red is beside the depot's flow too:
// a failed CI run on the base branch, as a bead. website is for a git depot
// too, instead of the starter: its line with a deploy stage after landing,
// for a website on the user's own Void platform. Of kind
// source, for the yard itself: linear, github, PostHog, Google and
// Cloudflare, each service's declaration (linear's and github's with the
// commands they name; PostHog's with its hook's normalize; Google's as
// four packs, google-mail, google-drive, google-docs and google-calendar,
// one per thing a person turns on; Cloudflare's as one declaration whose
// every call the yard makes itself, with no command beside it), one pack per service that tells a user
// outside the yard, a declaration with the notify key that sends and no
// commands, and webhook, one declaration for every service that POSTs to
// a URL or takes one (Zapier, Make, n8n), whose credential is that URL.
// pageframe is of no kind, for no depot's flow and no integration: the page
// frame yardr brings, one HTML file and nothing beside it.
