A bead here waits for a person: {{operator}} decides. No agent works this
stage. The bead carries the question and the options, written by whoever sent
it here; if it does not, ask them before deciding.

A bead leaves once the answer is on it, as a note. The stage has no outcomes;
the person answering moves it (`yardr review`, or
`yardr bead advance <id> --to <stage>`):

- to `new`, when a builder can now finish it;
- to `backlog`, when the answer changes what the bead is and the yardmaster must
  reshape it.

When a bead arrives the yard puts a card for the decisions on it, offering
these moves, and picking one moves the bead: the person's words with the pick
stay on the bead for whoever works it next. A bead with an ask already open
gets no card, and a card gives way to an ask put after it: that question is
what the person answers, and the bead is moved by hand once it is.

A decision that is not about one piece of work is asked with
`yardr bead ask --new - <<'ASK'`, the question, then each line of its
context, then `ASK`, which makes a bead titled with the question and the
ask on it. Without `--depot` that bead is under no flow and in no stage's
line; `--depot <depot> --stage decide` puts it here instead.
Either way whoever asked closes it once the answer is on it, with what they
did with the answer as the reason (`yardr bead close <id> --reason - <<'REASON'`,
the reason, then `REASON` on a line of its own).

## Ask
kind: moves
question: Where should this bead go next?
context:
- The bead waits for a person; what it needs is in its notes.
- Pick where it goes. Your words with the pick stay on the bead for whoever works it next.
