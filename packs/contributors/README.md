# yardr contributors pack

The pack yardr ships for what comes to a public repository from outside: an
issue or a pull request someone opens there is a bead in the yard, a
maintainer looks at it first, and a pull request is reviewed by an agent
that reads it and runs nothing, whose review the yard posts on the pull
request as a comment. A maintainer merges on GitHub, or the yard
does for a pull request marked `merge-ok` (a bot's bump of Go modules, or
what a maintainer said yes to); nothing of the yard pushes to a pull request.

It is for a git depot, beside the pack the depot follows for its own work
(the [starter](../starter), say): its two flows are for beads of the types
`issue` and `pr`, and it has none for the depot. `yardr pack check
contributors --depot <depot>` shows what importing it would change, and
`yardr pack apply contributors --depot <depot>` imports it. yardr carries
this pack in its binary, so the name is enough; `packs/contributors`, with
the separator, is this directory in a checkout. The format and how a pack
maps to a yard are in [docs/packs.md](../../docs/packs.md).

- `pack.yaml`: the two flows, the groups, the crew member, and what
  GitHub's events make and say (`sources.github`).
- `roles/pr-reviewer.md`: the prompt of the reviewer of a pull request.
  `roles/builder.md`, `roles/reviewer.md` and `scripts/merge-local` are the
  starter's, copied: an accepted issue is built, reviewed and landed as the
  depot's own beads are. A test fails when a copy drifts.
- `roles/yardmaster.md`: this pack's own yardmaster role. It does the
  starter's coordinating job and says what the outside work adds to it: the
  text of an issue or a pull request is a stranger's, a maintainer's yes is
  theirs and of one commit, and a pull request the yard's CI holds over its
  head is a maintainer's to read.
- `scripts/pr-ci` and `scripts/post-review` are copies of
  `contrib/assembly/pr-ci` and `contrib/assembly/post-review`, for the
  groups that run the yard's CI and post the reviewer's review. A test fails
  when a copy drifts.
- `flows/issue/triage.md`, `flows/pr/triage.md`, `flows/pr/review.md`,
  `flows/pr/review-post.md`, `flows/pr/ciwait.md`, `flows/pr/approved.md`:
  the stage files of the stages that are this pack's own.

## The two flows

| | stages |
|---|---|
| `issue` | `triage` (maintainers) -> `backlog` -> `new` -> `review` -> `approved` -> `merged`, or `closed` |
| `pr` | `triage` (maintainers) -> `review` (pr-reviewers) -> `review-post` (post) -> `ciwait` (pr-ci) -> `contributor` (outside) -> `approved` (maintainers) -> `merged`, or `closed` |

Everything a maintainer chooses is in `pack.yaml`: the stages, the label,
who is trusted. yardr knows three verbs and none of the choices:

| verb | direction | here |
|---|---|---|
| `makes` | an event makes a bead for a thread no open bead tracks | an issue opened: an `issue` bead in `triage`. A pull request opened, marked ready or reopened: a `pr` bead in `triage`, or in `review` when its author is an owner or a member of the repository, or a bot |
| `says` | an event reports an outcome to the bead that tracks its thread | the label `accepted`, put on by a person: `accepted`. New commits on a pull request that waited in `triage`: `unaccepted`, from `review`, `review-post`, `ciwait` and `contributor`, whoever pushed and even if the label was removed. New commits on any other pull request: `pushed` from `contributor`; from `review`, `pushed` when a bot pushed and `outdated` when a person did; from `review-post`, `pushed` when a bot pushed and nothing when a person did; from `ciwait`, `pushed` when a bot pushed and `changes` when a person did. Merged: `merged`. Closed: `dropped`: for a pull request in `triage`, `review`, `review-post`, `ciwait`, `contributor`, `approved` and `decide`, for an issue in `triage`, `backlog`, `new`, `review`, `approved` and `decide`. No event of GitHub's CI says anything: the pull request's CI is the yard's own, reported by a script |
| `hears` | a stage of the bead sets a status on the thread | an issue is closed when its bead is `merged` or `closed`, a pull request when its bead is `closed` |

**Triage is the pack's advice, not a rule of yardr.** The stage a bead
starts in is a line of `makes`, so a copy of this pack may send more
authors straight to `review` (another `association=`), or everyone. What
the stage is for is in its stage file: nothing of the yard runs outside
code before a person has judged it, so a maintainer checks whether the
person and the code are legit before anything of the pull request is run
anywhere, and the label `accepted` sends it on.

**A maintainer's yes is of one commit.** The label `accepted`, put on a pull
request by a person, moves its bead out of `triage` and records the head the
label event named as the bead's `accepted_head`. A label a bot puts (a
workflow that sorts or sizes pull requests) is no yes and moves nothing.
Nothing is read or run at another commit: new commits on a pull request that
bears the label, or that waited in `triage`, take its bead back to `triage`,
with the outcome `unaccepted`, from `review`, `review-post`, `ciwait` and
`contributor`, whoever pushed and a bot included. A maintainer says yes again
to the head it now has by adding the label `accepted`; if it is still there,
take it off and put it on again. A pull request no maintainer accepted, a
trusted author's or a bot's own, has no label to go by, and its pushes keep
the lines below. The yard's CI holds each head to the commit that was accepted
(`pr-ci`, below).

**A bot's pull request skips triage, whichever bot.** The line of `makes`
that sends it to `review` is `sender=bot`: `sender` is the kind GitHub types
what acted as (user, bot or organization) and never a login, so no line can
name Dependabot alone. A human from outside keeps the hold.

**A reopened pull request gets a new bead.** A close ends its bead, so no
open bead tracks the thread when someone reopens it, and the same lines of
`makes` judge it. `sender` is then whoever reopened it, so a person who
reopens a bot's pull request leaves it in `triage`. The new bead starts with
none of the old one's notes, labels or heads (`accepted_head`,
`reviewed_head`, `ci_head`, `merge_head`), and the old bead stays closed with
a link to the thread that only relates.

**`merge-ok` is the reviewer's to give for one kind of pull request.** A
bump of Go modules from a bot, whose title opens `build(deps)` and whose
diff changes `go.mod` or `go.sum` and nothing else, gets the label from the
reviewer when it reports `done` (`yardr bead update <id> --add-label
merge-ok`, which goes over the yard's socket). The label says the yard may
merge the pull request from `approved`. For any other pull request it is a
maintainer's to add.

**The stage `review-post` posts the review, worked by `post-review`.** The
reviewer holds no key, so its review is data: it stores the review on the bead
with the head it read, and when it reports `done` or `changes` a script of the
yard posts it on the pull request as the yard's GitHub App and sends the bead
on, `done` to `ciwait` and `changes` to `contributor`. It is always a comment,
never an approval or a request for changes: merging is a maintainer's, and a
request for changes would stand on the pull request after its author had
acted, since nothing posts again. The comment's first line is the verdict
(`Approved`, `Changes needed`), written by the script, which posts only what
it checks: the pull request is the one the bead tracks, linked by the hook that
made the bead (a link made by a person or an agent of the yard is held, not
posted on), it is open, and it has the head the reviewer read, else the review
goes back to the reviewer once and then to `decide`. The script gives the bead
no label, and a question is never posted.

**`post-review` works as the yard's GitHub App, so the yard sets its group up
first.** The script is `scripts/post-review`, the copy of
`contrib/assembly/post-review` (a test fails when they differ). The App's id
and key file are the group's `env_file`, which an import cannot ask for, so a
yard makes the group once, for all its depots, and maps the pack's to it:
`--group post=yardr-post` (docs/line.md, "Posting a pull request's review",
has the commands). The same group posts for the public line's review stages.
Imported without that, the pack makes the depot's own `<depot>-post` and the
route, and the group needs its `env_file` and the mint before it runs.

**The stage `ciwait` is the yard's own CI, worked by `pr-ci`.** A reviewed
pull request waits there while the script runs the depot's test command on
its head: the one every landing runs, from the base's copy where the command
is a file the base has, in a checkout of the head of its own. Green is
`done`, to `approved`, with the commit recorded as `ci_head`; red, or a
person's new commits meanwhile, is `changes`, to `contributor`; a bot's new
commits meanwhile are `pushed`, back to `review` (below); new commits
meanwhile on a pull request a maintainer accepted are `unaccepted`, back to
`triage`. It is a stage of
its own, not the end of `review`, because the reviewer runs nothing (its
sandbox reaches the yard's socket and nothing else), and because a fork's
code runs on the yard's machine only after a reviewer has read it, which
getting to `ciwait` means. A run that is no verdict on the pull request (no
test command, no token, a failed fetch) holds the bead for the yard's
operator, and the pull request is not called green untested.

**The head that is posted and tested is the head the reviewer read.** The
reviewer records the commit it read as the bead's `reviewed_head` right before
it reports `done` or `changes`, in the one update that stores its review
(`yardr bead update <id> --meta reviewed_head=<sha> --meta review=<JSON>`,
over the yard's socket, on its own bead only). That is the head its worktree stands on,
which the yard fetched when its session began; where its sandbox lets it
fetch, it looks at the pull request's head once more first, and at the diff
again if it moved, but the read-only sandbox reaches no network. `pr-ci` runs
the tests only if the head GitHub says the pull request has when it starts is
that commit. A push in between whose event came late or never, as an event
can, leaves another head: the bead is held with both commits named, nothing
of the pull request is fetched or run, and `yardr bead advance <id> --to
review` (then `yardr bead unhold <id>`) has it read again as it now is. A
bead with no `reviewed_head` is held the same way.

**A pull request that waited in `triage` is tested at the commit that was
accepted.** The bead carries it as `accepted_head`, which the yard writes when
the label `accepted` moves the bead and a maintainer writes when they move it
by hand (`yardr bead update <id> --meta accepted_head=<sha>`, with the sha of
the head they looked at). `pr-ci` compares it with the head GitHub says the
pull request has, before it fetches anything, in any case of the letters. A
head that differs, or none recorded, holds the bead with both commits named,
and a maintainer who has read the head records it as the one they accept and
unholds the bead (`yardr bead unhold <id>`). A bead's agent may not write
`accepted_head`, on its own bead or another's. A bead that never waited in
`triage`, made in `review` by a line of `makes`, is held to the reviewer's
record alone.

**`pr-ci` works as the yard's GitHub App, so the yard sets its group up
first.** The script is `scripts/pr-ci`, the copy of `contrib/assembly/pr-ci`
(a test fails when they differ). The App's id and key file are the group's
`env_file`, which an import cannot ask for, so a yard makes the group once,
for all its depots, and maps the pack's to it: `--group pr-ci=pr-ci`
(docs/line.md, "The yard as the CI of a pull request", has the commands).
Imported without that, the pack makes the depot's own `<depot>-pr-ci` and
the route, and the group needs its `env_file` and the mint before it runs.

**The yard merges what is marked `merge-ok`, and only that.** The
pack brings no script for it: the merge is `contrib/assembly/merge-pr`
of the yardr checkout, run by an `exec` group routed for `approved`, type
`pr`, label `merge-ok` (docs/line.md, "Merging pull requests"). It merges
as the yard's GitHub App, at the head a maintainer's yes recorded
(`yardr bead update <id> --add-label merge-ok --meta merge_head=<sha>`)
or, for a bot's pull request from the repository's own branch, at the head
it has, and only where the yard's CI has passed on that commit (the bead's
`ci_head`). A pull request without the label waits in `approved` for a
maintainer, as before. What stops a merge holds the bead with a note, and
the bead reports `merged` or `dropped` and nothing else.

**A bot's push starts the read again.** A bot's rebase is the only push it
makes, so a bead sent to `contributor` by it would wait there for one that
does not come. A push by a bot (`sender=bot`, a kind as in the line of
`makes`, so every bot) while the pull request is read, its review is posted
or it waits on CI says `pushed`, which leads from `review`, `review-post` and
`ciwait` back to `review`. From `review` the bead stays, as a new stay: the
session reading the old head ends and a new one reads the new head. From
`review-post` and `ciwait` it goes back to be read, and is posted and waits
for CI on the new head after. A person's push is as it was: `outdated` from
`review` and `changes` from `ciwait`, to `contributor`, until the next
commits (`outdated` is the source's word and not the reviewer's `changes`,
which the posting takes). The posting is done in moments, so a person's push
meanwhile says nothing to it: the script's check of the head sends the
review of the old head back to `review`, where the new head is read. The line
comes before the person's in the table, since the first line an event
matches counts.
Both are for a pull request no maintainer accepted: on one that waited in
`triage`, every push says `unaccepted`, even after the label was removed.

**The stage `contributor` is held by `outside`, a people group with no
members.** Nobody of the yard works a bead there: it waits for the pull
request to change, and the next commits on it say `pushed` (`unaccepted` on a
pull request a maintainer accepted). In `yardr review` it shows where the pull
request waits.

**A merge or a close moves the bead itself.** When the pull request is
merged on GitHub, the `merged` outcome moves its bead to `merged`, and when it
is closed unmerged `dropped` moves it to `closed`: from `approved`, and as
well from `triage`, `review`, `review-post`, `ciwait`, `contributor` and
`decide`, since a
maintainer can merge a pull request nobody of the yard has read and its author
can close one under review, and the bead would otherwise wait in a stage for a
pull request that is over. A reviewer's `question` sends the bead to `decide`
to wait for a member of `decisions`, and a merge or a close meanwhile ends it
there, without the answer. In `ciwait` the run is stopped and a report it
still makes is refused, as after a push. The move out of a stage of people
(`triage`, `contributor`, `approved`, `decide`) is made as the hook's `as`
crew member (`yardmaster`): the pack's own mapping, not a stranger's word. An
agent that read the pull request still cannot move a bead out of a stage of
people by naming them. A bead the yard holds is moved by no event, so one held
in `ciwait` because its pull request was found over is advanced by hand.

**A close ends an issue's bead.** When the issue is closed on GitHub,
`dropped` moves its bead to `closed`: from `triage`, and as well from
`backlog`, `new`, `review`, `approved` and `decide`. The close is the
decision, made by someone who may close that repository's issues, and the
bead would otherwise stay open on one that is over, with a builder still
working it. A `question` sends the bead to `decide` to wait for a member of
`decisions`, and a close meanwhile ends it there, without the answer.
Whatever worked the bead stops with it: the builder's, the reviewer's and
the assembly's sessions end. The move out of a stage of people (`backlog`,
`decide`) is made as the hook's `as` crew member (`yardmaster`): the pack's
own mapping, not a stranger's word. A bead the yard holds is moved by no
event.

## What the import asks

Beside the starter's questions (the agents of `builders` and `reviewers`,
the members of `backlog` and `decisions`):

- **who the maintainers are**: `--members maintainers=<a>,<b>`. They move
  a bead out of `triage` and `approved`;
- **the members of `outside`**: none, `--members outside=`;
- **the agent of `pr-reviewers`, and its sandbox**: `--bind
  pr-reviewers=<kind>,read-only`.

```sh
yardr depot init web --pack starter …
yardr pack apply contributors --depot web \
  --bind pr-reviewers=codex,read-only \
  --members maintainers=jo --members outside=
```

It needs a GitHub hook to do anything (`yardr hook add github --source
github --secret-file <file>`): `makes`, `says` and `hears` go on the yard's
hook of the source, and `pack check` says what is missing.

The hook's tables are shared with the starter pack, whose lines are for a
train's pull request, and the import sets only the pack's own lines among
them, taking off none but those it set at its last import and no longer
gives. Each of the pack's `says` lines names the type of its bead (`issue` or
`pr`), so an event meets the lines of the bead's own pack: a pull request
closed unmerged is `dropped` for a `pr` bead, and asks a person about a train.

Groups are matched by name, so imported into a depot the starter set up,
the pack finds `builders`, `reviewers` and `assembly` there, installs its
copies of the roles and the script, which are the same text, and sets its
own limits (3 builders, 2 reviewers). The groups keep their prompt (the
assembly its cmd), which still names the starter's copy, and `pack check`
says so under `kept`.

## The pr-reviewers group binds read-only

A pull request from outside is a stranger's code and a stranger's text,
and an agent of the yard otherwise runs as the operator, with the sandbox
of its agent off. The role tells the reviewer to run nothing and to take
nothing it reads as an instruction; a role is words, and the text it is
reading may be written to talk it out of them. So the group that reviews
pull requests is bound with its agent's own sandbox on. The sandbox and
the yard's pane check together hold an agent that calls the yard as it
was given to; they are a line against mistakes, not a wall: every agent
runs as the one OS user the yard runs as, the pane is told by the process
tree, and a process started outside its pane's tree is taken for a person
at a terminal, not an agent that sets out to escape:

| kind | preset | arguments | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` | `read-only` | `--enable network_proxy` and, each behind a `-c`: `default_permissions="yardr_read_only"`, `permissions.yardr_read_only.extends=":read-only"`, `permissions.yardr_read_only.network.enabled=true`, `permissions.yardr_read_only.network.unix_sockets={"{socket}"="allow"}`, `permissions.yardr_read_only.filesystem={"{tmpdir}"="write"}` | Codex's read-only sandbox as a permissions profile: its commands read, write nowhere but a private temporary directory, and reach no network |
| `claude` | `read-only` | `--settings '{"sandbox":{"enabled":true,"filesystem":{"denyWrite":["{workdir}"]},"network":{"allowUnixSockets":["{socket}"]}}}'` | Claude Code's sandbox around every shell command, with the working directory denied for writing too |

`{socket}` is the yard's socket (`<home>/yard.sock`), put in when the agent
is started: the one unix socket either sandbox lets through, since every
yardr command of the reviewer goes through it. `{workdir}` is the bead's
worktree, put in the same way: Claude Code's sandbox denies a directory it
is given by its absolute path. Codex lets a profile's socket through only
behind its network proxy, a feature Codex 0.160.1 calls experimental; with
no domain allowed, the proxy refuses every host, and a Codex without the
feature does not start.

`{tmpdir}` is a directory the runner makes for the reviewer's session,
beside the worktrees, for the yard's user alone, and removes when the
session ends. It is the one place Codex's profile lets a command write. A
shell makes a temporary file for a here-document, so without it the
reviewer could not write its note as stdin from a quoted heredoc, the form
that keeps the backticks in a review from being run. The runner points
`TMPDIR` and, for zsh, `TMPPREFIX` at the directory. macOS's own `sh` and
`bash` (3.2) make that file in `/var/tmp` whatever `TMPDIR` says, so the
heredoc is still refused under either of them; Codex runs its commands in
the login shell, which is zsh on a Mac.

A group bound before the directory was added keeps the arguments it was
bound with, and they have no `{tmpdir}`. Its sandbox writes nowhere, and every
heredoc of its reviewer is refused. The role then has the reviewer give the
same words through a pipe, which makes no file, so the review is still
stored. `yardr group set <depot>-pr-reviewers preset="read only"` gives the
group the current arguments, `{tmpdir}` among them, and heredocs work again.

`--bind pr-reviewers=codex,read-only` at the import, or `yardr depot init
<depot> --bind pr-reviewers=codex,read-only` where a depot is set up from a
pack that has the group. A kind without the preset is refused by name; give
such a group arguments of your own (`yardr group set <depot>-pr-reviewers
'args=[…]'`) or another kind. The import's default for an agent it creates
is the kind's unattended arguments, which for Codex turn the sandbox off:
**bind this group explicitly.**

A reviewer that cannot run cannot run the tests. For a pull request from
outside that is the yard's CI run's job, in the stage after the review, and
after approval a maintainer's.

**What the sandbox also stops.** It denies the network, so inside it the
reviewer cannot fetch the pull request's head. It does not have to:
before the reviewer starts, yardr puts the head in the bead's worktree
itself — at every start of a session on a bead that tracks a pull
request it fetches `refs/pull/<n>/head` from the depot's `origin` and
checks it out detached, and a fetch that fails fails the start as
blocked, so no session reviews the base by mistake. What still needs a
maintainer in the pane is the fallback: when the head has moved
mid-session the role fetches it again, a command the sandbox refuses,
and as these presets leave them Codex and Claude Code ask in the pane
for leave to run it outside. The reading, the note that is the review
and the outcome need nobody.

## Not in this pack

`CONTRIBUTING.md` and a pull request template are the repository's own.
What a maintainer says to a contributor beyond the review is not here either:
they post it themselves (`yardr reply`), in their own words.
