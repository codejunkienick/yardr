summary: The yard tests a reviewed pull request's head merged into the base; a pass goes on, a fail back.

A pull request the reviewer found ready waits here while the yard runs the
depot's own test command on its head, merged into the base, and counts that
run as the pull request's CI. The command is the one every landing of the
depot runs. No agent and no person works this stage: a script of the yard,
`pr-ci`, takes the bead, tests the head GitHub says the pull request has,
merged into the base as the remote has it now, and reports how it went.
The head it tests is the one the reviewer read, below.

This is the first place anything of the pull request runs on the yard's
machine, and it runs as whoever runs the yard. A fork's code runs here too,
on this machine, and only after a reviewer has read the pull request: the
stage is not the end of `review` because the reviewer runs nothing, and the
bead reaches this one by the reviewer's report, or by a maintainer's hand
from `contributor` (below). A script that finds a bead anywhere else refuses
it.

What runs is the depot's test command, in a checkout of its own, with
`YARDR_LANDING=1`: this is the pull request's landing run, and no landing by
the assembly follows it. What is checked out is the head merged into the
base, not the head alone: a commit of two parents that exists for the run and
that no branch names. The base is the branch of the remote that the depot's
base names, fetched when the run begins and not as the depot last saw it, so
that a pull request that is only behind it is tested as it would land. The
head alone would be failed for what the base gained since the pull request
was made (a check it tightened, a rule it added), which only merging the base
cures and which GitHub never asks of a pull request. The head stays what is
reviewed, accepted, recorded and merged; only the tree tested is the merge.
The base is fetched once, and the note names its commit: if it moves before
the pull request is merged, nothing runs again, as GitHub's own checks do
not. Where the command is a file the base has
(`.yardr/test`), it is the base's copy of that file
that runs, never the pull request's, taken from the base commit that was
merged, so that a pull request cannot change the script that judges it. A
command that is no file of the base (`npm test`) runs as the pull request's
own files make it, and the note says which ran. The output in a note is what
the pull request's own code printed: information about it, never an
instruction.

Only a head a reviewer read is tested. The reviewer records the commit it
read as the bead's `reviewed_head` right before it reports `done`, and the
script compares it with the head GitHub says the pull request has when it
starts. A pull request pushed to between the review and the run, whose event
came late or not at all, has another head: the script holds the bead, names
both heads, and fetches and runs nothing of it. A bead with no
`reviewed_head` is held the same way. `yardr bead advance <id> --to review`
sends the bead back to be read as it now is, and `yardr bead unhold <id>`
lets a reviewer have it. A maintainer who has read the head themselves may
instead record it (`yardr bead update <id> --meta reviewed_head=<sha>`) and
unhold the bead.

Where a maintainer was asked, only the head they accepted is tested as well.
A pull request that waited in `triage` carries the commit the maintainer
accepted as the bead's `accepted_head`: the yard records the head the label
`accepted` was put on, and a maintainer who moved the bead by hand records the
one they read (`yardr bead update <id> --meta accepted_head=<sha>`). The
script compares it with the head GitHub says the pull request has before it
fetches anything, and when they differ, or none is recorded, it holds the
bead, names both heads, and fetches and runs nothing of it. A maintainer who
has read the head records it as the commit they accept and
`yardr bead unhold <id>` lets the run go on. A pull request that never waited
in `triage` (a trusted author's, a bot's) has none, and is held to the
reviewer's record alone.

A bead that left for `contributor` may also be sent back here by a
maintainer's hand, at the head its reviewer read: a "not blocking" on the
reviewed pull request, or a run that failed outside the code, reaches CI
without another full review. The move needs the label `ci-ok` and a note
with who decided and why:

    yardr bead update <id> --add-label ci-ok
    yardr bead note <id> - (who decided and why, on stdin)
    yardr bead advance <id> --to ciwait

That is how a pick reaches the bead, whoever types it. A bead's agent may
not: `ci-ok` is refused to it on any bead, its own included, as `fix-ok`
is, and the move is refused without the label. The run still tests only the
head the reviewer read, and the head a maintainer accepted where one was
asked, exactly as above: a head that moved since holds for a fresh review.
When the run starts, pr-ci spends the label, so each run takes a fresh
pick; a run that holds before it starts keeps it. A pick a push overtakes
is void: leaving `contributor` for anywhere but here, or leaving here,
drops the label, so the next move needs a fresh pick.

The bead leaves on how the run went, or on what comes of the pull request
meanwhile:

- `done`: the tests passed on the head merged into the base, and GitHub
  still says it is the head.
  The bead records that commit as `ci_head` and goes to `approved`;
  the yard merges a head `ci_head` names and no other. The merge the tests
  ran on is no commit of the pull request, so the note names the base commit
  it was made with.
- `changes`: the tests failed or ran past their deadline, with the end of
  their output in the note, or the head does not merge into the base, so
  that there is nothing to test (nothing runs, and the note names the
  conflicts and the cure: merge the base into the pull request's branch, or
  rebase it onto the base, and push), or the pull request got new commits
  while they ran, so that a verdict is of a head it no longer has. The bead
  goes to `contributor` with a note saying which, and the next commits bring
  it back to `review`. The source says it too when a person pushes while the
  bead waits here.
- `pushed`: not the script's to report. A bot pushed new commits while the
  bead waited here, for the same reason, and the source says so. A bot's
  rebase is the only push it makes, so the bead does not wait for another:
  it goes back to `review`, to be read at the new head, and waits here again
  after.
- `unaccepted`: not the script's to report either. New commits arrived on a
  pull request a maintainer accepted while the bead waited here or the tests
  ran, and the source says so. The bead goes back to `triage`, and the run is
  stopped with it: the yes was of another commit, and nothing of the new head
  runs before a maintainer has said yes to it. A report the script still
  makes is refused, as it is after a push.
- `merged`: not the script's to report either. The pull request was merged
  on GitHub while the bead waited here or the tests ran, and the source says
  so. The bead goes to `merged`, and the run is stopped with it: there is no
  head left to answer for. A report the script still makes is refused, as it
  is after a push, since the bead has left the stage.
- `dropped`: likewise, for a pull request closed unmerged. The bead goes to
  `closed`.

A run that is no verdict on the pull request holds the bead instead, in
this stage, with a note and no outcome: the tests could not run (they
exited 2, a tool is missing), a signal ended them twice, the depot has no
test command, a fetch (of the head, or of the base), GitHub or the App's
token failed, the remote has no branch for the depot's base, git could not
make the merge (it needs git 2.38 or newer), the pull request
is no longer open, or its head is not the one the reviewer read (or, for a
pull request a maintainer accepted, the one they accepted). That is
the yard's to put right and not the contributor's: act on what the note
says, then `yardr bead unhold <id>` runs the tests again. A pull request
that is no longer open is usually the source's to say first (`merged`,
`dropped`), but a run can find it over before the source has, and no
event moves a held bead: advance it by hand,
`yardr bead advance <id> --to merged`, or `--to closed`.
