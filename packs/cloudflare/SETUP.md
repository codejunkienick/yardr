# Setting up Cloudflare

The pack wires Cloudflare into the yard as the declared source
`cloudflare`: the user's own account read as wrangler reads it —
accounts, zones, Workers scripts, Email Routing rules and destination
addresses — and written to as wrangler writes it: a Worker uploaded
from a file, a Worker secret put from a secret file, and an Email
Routing rule made or edited to send one address to a Worker, each
write proposed and approved on its own card (step 5).

1. **The API token, in Cloudflare.** My Profile → API Tokens →
   Create Token → Create Custom Token (or the "Edit Cloudflare
   Workers" template, trimmed to this list), with exactly these
   minimum scopes, on one account and one zone, plus the user-scoped
   permission needed to read the token's own policy:
   - **API Tokens Read** (User; needed for GET
     `/user/tokens/<token_id>` to report this token's scopes)
   - **Workers Scripts Edit** (Account)
   - **Email Routing Addresses Read** (Account)
   - **Email Routing Rules Edit** (Zone)
   - **Zone Read** (Zone)

   Account Resources: the one account. Zone Resources: the one zone.
   API Tokens Read is a User permission; it is not an account-wide or
   zone-wide grant.
   The yard reads Workers scripts and destination addresses under the
   account, Email Routing rules under the zone, and zones under the
   Zone Read permission. What the token may do is read back after
   setup, from the token itself (step 4): a scope it lacks shows
   there, beside this list. Copy the
   token once: Cloudflare shows it once.
2. **The setup card.** One card carries the pack's whole setup: the
   pack, the token and the grants. Have a crew member ask for it,
   and approve it, in footplate or in `yardr chat` (`ctrl+o`); a
   person sets up the packs they want, one card each:
   ```sh
   yardr bead ask <bead> - --setup cloudflare --crew yardmaster --recommend 1 <<'ASK'
   Q: Set up Cloudflare for the yardmaster?
   C: The yardmaster reads the account, its zones, Workers scripts and Email Routing as wrangler reads them.
   W: reading is the job
   ASK
   ```
   The card shows the declaration whole, the token to type unseen,
   and one option per preset. Approving it applies the pack, keeps
   the token as the source's secret in
   `~/.yardr/sources/cloudflare.env` (mode 0600, named in the
   answer, never the value), and grants the preset picked. The
   token is in no call's arguments, then or later.
   By hand it is the operator's to type, starting with the pack:
   ```sh
   yardr pack apply cloudflare
   # applied pack cloudflare to the yard: 1 created, 0 changed, 0 unchanged
   # source cloudflare is declared: 11 calls under https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4 (yardr source show cloudflare)
   yardr source key cloudflare           # CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, typed unseen
   ```
3. **The grants.** A pack of kind source asks none at import, so
   what a crew member may call is picked on the setup card as one
   preset. The pack's preset, as `yardr pack show cloudflare`
   prints it numbered:
   1. `read`: every read call — the token verified and read with
      its scopes, accounts and zones listed, Workers scripts,
      Email Routing rules and addresses listed — and it covers
      any read call the source is later given; writes nothing.
   2. `deploy`: every read, and the four update calls — a Worker
      uploaded, a Worker secret put, and an Email Routing rule
      made or edited. Whoever holds it makes those calls with no
      card of their own, so offering it makes this setup card a
      strong one: approving it hands those calls out for good, and
      the hosted web asks a fresh sign-in for it.

   By hand it is the operator's to type:
   ```sh
   yardr source grant cloudflare read --crew yardmaster
   ```
4. **Check it, and pick the account and zone.** The check verifies
   the stored token; the reads then name what the token can read:
   ```sh
   yardr source check cloudflare
   # cloudflare: credential: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN is set in ~/.yardr/sources/cloudflare.env
   # cloudflare: check call verify (GET /user/tokens/verify): 200 in …ms, … bytes
   # cloudflare: success: true
   # cloudflare: result: {"id":"<token id>","status":"active"}
   yardr call cloudflare accounts
   yardr call cloudflare zones
   yardr call cloudflare token token_id=<the id verify showed>
   ```
   `token` answers the token's policies: the scopes Cloudflare
   reports for it, to set beside step 1's five. A scope the token
   lacks is the one of the five its policies do not name. Then, with
   the account and zone picked from the lists:
   ```sh
   yardr call cloudflare workers account=<account id>
   yardr call cloudflare email_rules zone=<zone id>
   yardr call cloudflare email_addresses account=<account id>
   ```
   Each answers Cloudflare's envelope after its selection:
   `success`, the `result` list, and `result_info`. A list the
   token may not read answers 403 there, with the call named;
   remake the token with the missing scope (step 1) and give it
   again (step 2).
5. **The writes, each on its own card.** A write to Cloudflare is
   proposed as one call and approved on one card; the card shows
   what the call sends. A crew member who may not make the call
   proposes it, and the operator approves it where the card's
   weight is approved (a strong card in a terminal, in footplate,
   or in the hosted web after a fresh sign-in):
   ```sh
   yardr bead ask <bead> - <<'ASK'
   Q: Upload the Worker?
   C: The card shows the file's SHA-256 digest; those bytes are what is sent.
   R: call cloudflare worker_upload account=<account id> name=<worker> script=<file>
   ASK
   yardr bead ask <bead> - <<'ASK'
   Q: Put the Worker's secret?
   C: The yard reads the value from the secret file when the approved call is made.
   R: call cloudflare worker_secret account=<account id> name=<worker> secret=<SECRET_NAME> value=<secret file>
   ASK
   yardr bead ask <bead> - <<'ASK'
   Q: Send mail to the Worker?
   C: Mail to the address is then handed to the Worker.
   R: call cloudflare email_rule zone=<zone id> address=<address> worker=<worker>
   ASK
   ```
   The upload card shows the file's SHA-256 digest; those bytes
   are what is sent, and a changed file is a new card. The secret
   card shows the secret's name and the file's name alone; the
   yard reads the value from that file when the approved call is
   made, and the value stands in no card, note or record. To send
   an address to a Worker where a rule for it stands, list the
   rules first (`email_rules`) and edit the standing rule rather
   than making a second: `R: call cloudflare email_rule_edit
   zone=<zone id> rule=<rule id> address=<address> worker=<worker>`.
   The operator may also make each call at a terminal without a
   card: `yardr call cloudflare <call> …`.

What is not there, on purpose: deleting a Worker, a secret or a
rule; other Cloudflare products (DNS, R2, Pages); wrangler itself;
and no credential but the one token.
