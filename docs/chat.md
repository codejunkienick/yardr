# yardr chat: talking with the residents

`yardr chat` is one view of the yard's [residents](residents.md) and your
conversation with each, in a terminal. It is the same for every harness a
resident runs, and you do not have to find the resident's pane to say
something to it.

```sh
yardr chat             # opens on the mayor
yardr chat refinery    # opens on the resident named
```

It shows the mail a [user](users.md) and a resident have written each other,
and what you type is mail: `yardr chat` adds no other channel. What it shows
is what `yardr mail --with <resident>` prints, and Enter does what
`yardr mail <resident> <text>` does. What the yard itself reports to you,
your notifications, is in no conversation: it has a row of its own,
[`yard`](#the-yard).

## From the onboarding

The onboarding ends here. Once the form has started the yard and the mayor
is up, "Talk to the mayor" (the answer its last question starts at) opens
this view on the mayor, in the terminal the form ran in.
`yardr init --start` in a terminal does the same without the question, and
so does "Talk to the mayor" after a page of [`yardr setup`](setup.md).

The mayor that `yardr init` adds is asked, in the first prompt of its first
session, to greet the operator by mail and to say what it needs for the next
setup step ([configuration.md](configuration.md#starting-the-yard)). So its
first message is there when the view opens, or arrives while you watch:
until there is mail between you, the conversation says

```
mayor is starting: it reads its role first, and its first message appears here.
You can write to it already.
```

What you type goes to the mayor as mail, and it answers by mail: its role
says the setup conversation stays by mail when it began there. What the
mayor does in between is in its pane (`ctrl+g`).

Leaving the view prints one line and stops nothing:

```
You left the chat; mayor keeps running. To come back: yardr chat
```

It does not open from the onboarding:

- without a terminal, with `--json`, in an agent's own session, and with
  `--no-chat` (`yardr init --start --no-chat`, `yardr setup --no-chat`):
  yardr then prints where the mayor's pane is, as it did before there was a
  chat, and names `yardr chat`;
- when the mayor did not come up (not logged in, a harness that exits):
  nobody would answer, so the form prints what [`yardr doctor`](doctor.md)
  says of the yard instead, and how the onboarding is taken up again;
- when who runs the command is no user of the yard, which is the case when
  the form's "Your name" is another name than your login name: the mayor
  writes to the operator, so yardr says so and how to open the chat as them
  (`yardr --actor <operator> chat`).

## Who it is for

A user of the yard: the operator, and whoever the operator added with
`yardr user add`. The view acts as the user the command acts as (`--actor`,
else `$YARDR_ACTOR`, else the login name). Anyone else is told to ask the
operator for `yardr user add <name>`.

It needs a terminal. Without one (a script, a pipe, `--json`) it does not
start and names what does the same there: `yardr mail <resident> <text>`
sends, `yardr mail --with <resident> [--after <seq>] [--json]` reads the
conversation.

It shows residents only, and the `yard` row: no agents working a bead
(their channel is the bead) and no residents of other yards.

From 100 columns the rows (`yard`, then the residents) are a column on the
left, one a line, with `>` before the selected one and the unread number at
the column's right edge; narrower, they fold into the one line on top, the
selected one in brackets and the number in parentheses.

The colours are those of the onboarding's forms, for a light and a dark
terminal, and say nothing the words and marks do not; with `NO_COLOR` set,
or in a terminal without colour, the view is plain text.

**The residents.** Each with its state and, when there is any, the number of
mails from it you have not seen:

| State | Means |
|---|---|
| `not running` | no session runs: it was stopped, or the daemon has not started it yet |
| `working` | its session is in a turn |
| `idle` | its session waits for a prompt; the daemon nudges it about new mail |
| `blocked` | its session waits at a prompt only a person in its pane can answer (a permission, a question) |
| `failed to start` | its last start failed; `yardr resident show <name>` says why |
| `running` | a session runs and the daemon has not said more yet, or its runner cannot tell |

Above the residents stands one row that is no resident, `yard`
([below](#the-yard)).

**The conversation** with the selected resident: oldest at the top, the
newest in view, each mail with its time and sender. `pgup` and `pgdn` scroll.

**Where a mail you sent stands** is the line under it. Mails that stand
alike share one line, under the last of them:

| Line | Means |
|---|---|
| `read` | the resident acknowledged it (`yardr inbox --ack`) |
| `sent; <name> is idle` | it is in the inbox, and the daemon nudges the idle session |
| `sent; <name> is working and reads mail when idle` | mail does not interrupt a turn |
| `<name> waits at a prompt in its pane and cannot read mail (ctrl+g goes there)` | someone has to answer the prompt in its pane first: it is `blocked`, or its first prompt is not delivered yet ([below](#a-resident-that-waits-in-its-pane)) |
| `<name> is not running: yardr resident start <name>` | the mail waits in its inbox for its next session |
| `<name> failed to start: yardr resident show <name>` | as above, and that command says why |

### A resident that waits in its pane

A harness can stop at something only a person at its pane can answer: a
login, a permission, a question, a dialog of the system. Mail does not reach
it there. While such a resident is selected, a notice stands above the line
you type in:

- one line of what yardr knows. For a `blocked` resident: `<name> waits at a
  prompt in its pane: <harness> may wait at a login, a question or a system
  dialog`. For one whose session runs and whose first prompt the daemon has
  not been able to deliver, whatever state it is listed with: `<harness> was
  started in the pane but is not ready for its first prompt: it may wait at
  a login, a question or a system dialog`, the sentence `yardr init --start`
  prints for a mayor in that place. A harness at a login screen is often
  listed `idle`: its runtime cannot tell the two apart, the daemon can,
  because the prompt it sent never showed;
- up to six of the last lines of its pane that say something, behind `│`:
  usually the question itself. They are read every 5 seconds while the
  notice shows. A pane that cannot be read (no herdr on this machine, the
  pane gone) leaves the notice without them;
- the key: `ctrl+g opens its pane; answer there and come back` in herdr,
  `ctrl+g names the command that opens its pane; …` anywhere else.

The notice is no mail and is kept nowhere. It is gone when the resident
goes on, and when another resident is selected. What you send meanwhile is
sent, and waits in the resident's inbox; the line under it says so in the
notice's words.

A pane's lines are shown as text and nothing else: escape sequences and
control characters in them are removed, and nothing in a pane is acted on
by the view or by your terminal.

The notice goes when the daemon has seen the resident go on, not when you
answered: up to 30 seconds later ([Live](#live)).

### The yard

The row `yard`, above the residents, is the yard reporting: the
notifications of the events you subscribed to
([subscriptions.md](subscriptions.md#users-as-subscribers)), the part
`yardr inbox --notifications` prints. It has no state, since nothing runs
behind it, and shows the number of notifications you have not read, when
there is any.

Selecting it shows the notifications in place of a conversation: oldest at
the top and the newest last, plain. Each is laid out as a mail is: a line
with its time and, where a sender's name would stand, the bead's id, then
the yard's text under it, less the id it would begin with. At 80 columns,
with one unread mail from the mayor:

```

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

tab next resident  pgup/pgdn scroll  ^c quit
```

- **There is no line to type in.** Nobody sent a notification, so there is
  nobody to answer. `enter` and `ctrl+g` do nothing here, and a key that
  would type says `nobody to answer here: the yard reports, tab goes to a
  resident`. To talk about one, select a resident and write to it.
- **A notification about a bead has the bead's id alone after its time**,
  whole on its line, so it can be copied into `yardr bead show <id>`. The
  view does not go there itself. A hook delivery's has its source there.
- **Unread notifications light up no resident.** A resident's number counts
  the mail from it and nothing else, whoever the notification says acted.
- The list is what the inbox keeps: the newest 500, the oldest dropped.

Without a subscription the row is there and says how it fills:

```
No notifications. The yard reports here what you subscribe to,
for one when beads land:
  yardr subscribe jo yardr --done
```

**Timers.** A mail whose text begins `timer:` was sent by the yard for a
timer the resident set for you (`yardr timer add --to <you>`,
[timers.md](timers.md)): the resident wrote the reason when it set the
timer, and was not woken when it fired.

A resident answers when it is idle and has read its inbox, so an answer takes
as long as its turn does. What it is working on in the meantime is in its
pane, not here.

**Reading.** Opening a conversation marks your unread mail in it as read, and
so does mail that arrives in the open one. A user's mail has one position
for all senders ([users.md](users.md#a-conversation)), so mail of a
conversation you have not opened holds back what came after it: nothing is
marked read that the view did not show. Mail from someone who is no resident
(another user) is not shown; the line above the keys counts it and names
`yardr inbox`.

The notifications have a position of their own
([users.md](users.md#the-inbox)): selecting `yard` marks them read and
marks no mail read, and reading a conversation leaves the number on `yard`
as it was.

## Keys

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `enter` | sends the line as mail to the selected resident, a [long text](#a-long-text) as several; nothing on `yard` |
| `ctrl+j`, `alt+enter` | a line break in the line |
| `tab`, `shift+tab` | the next, the previous row: `yard`, then the residents |
| `pgup`, `pgdn` | scroll the conversation |
| `ctrl+g` | to the selected resident's pane; nothing on `yard` |
| `ctrl+c` | leave |

A mail holds 4 KB. From three quarters of that the rule above the line
counts the bytes (`3072 of 4096 bytes`).

`ctrl+g` brings the resident's pane to the front when `yardr chat` runs in a
pane of herdr (`herdr agent focus <agent>`); the view goes on in its own
pane. Anywhere else it names the command that opens the pane from that
terminal: `herdr agent attach <agent>`.

Leaving the view stops nothing: the residents are the daemon's to keep
running, and mail goes on arriving in your inbox (`yardr inbox`).

## A long text

A text longer than one mail is sent as several. Type or paste it and send it as
any other: past one mail's size the rule says how many it comes to
(`9310 bytes, sent as 3 mails`), and Enter sends them one after the other.
Each begins with a line that numbers it:

```
(1/3)
The first paragraphs of the text …
```

They are ordinary mails. The conversation and `yardr mail --with` show three,
the resident's `yardr inbox` lists three in the order sent, and the numbers
tell it that they are one text and whether more follow. The line under the
last says where they stand.

A text is split where it reads best: at the last paragraph break (an empty
line) that leaves the mail at least half full, else at the last line break,
else at the last space, and a line that has none of these and is longer than
a mail is cut at the limit, between two characters. The break itself is not
sent.

If one of the mails is not taken, those after it are not sent: the line
above the keys says how many went (`1 of 3 mails went to mayor, the rest is
in the line: …`), and the text from that mail on is in the line again. Sent
from there it is a text of its own, numbered from 1.

A text is sent as at most 16 mails (about 64 KB); the line takes nothing
past that. More than that is a file, and the mail names it.

Only `yardr chat` splits. `yardr mail <resident> <text|->` sends one mail and
refuses a text over 4 KB, from stdin too.

## Live

New mail, mail being read and a resident's state appear without a key
press. They come from the yard's event stream, the one `yardr watch` prints:
the view reads the residents and a conversation once and applies events from
then on, and asks nothing of the yard in a loop. (The pane of a selected
resident that [waits in it](#a-resident-that-waits-in-its-pane) is not the
yard's: herdr is asked for it every 5 seconds, while that notice shows.) When the yardr server goes away (it
replaces itself after an install) the title says so, and the view subscribes
again after the last event it got, so nothing in between is lost.

Two kinds of event exist for this, and anything else that follows the
stream can use them:

- `resident_status`, with `resident`, `status` (`working`, `idle`, `blocked`
  or `unknown`) and `was`: the daemon saw the session do something else
  than on its pass before. The status is also on the resident
  (`yardr resident show <name> --json`, `status`). The daemon looks on every
  pass: after every change to the store, and every 30 seconds otherwise, so
  a session that starts or ends a turn with nothing else happening in the
  yard shows up to that much later.
- `mail_read`, with `reader` and `through`: a resident or a user
  acknowledged its inbox through that seq, and mail was among what it
  acknowledged.

The `yard` row follows two more things in the stream. An event that became
a notification names whom it told in its data, `notified` (user to reason),
and the view reads your notifications again when you are among them.
`notifications_read`, with `reader` and `through`, says a user acknowledged
their notifications through that seq.

Neither of the two above is on a bead, and the web view's feed leaves them out, but for a
resident that stops at a prompt or leaves it.

The view also reads the residents again on `session_prompted` and the other
`session_prompt_*` events of a resident: a first prompt that arrived changes
no status, and is what ends the notice of a resident that was not ready for
it.
