// A go test step that fails runs the failed packages (the FAIL lines) once
// more, alone, with the same flags: when they pass, the step passes, and one
// line starting with `test: flaky:` names the tests that failed the first
// time. A package that fails twice fails the step as before, with the failed
// lines. The plain run does the same as a landing. A run whose log reports a
// data race is never run again: the step fails, naming packages whose output
// reported the race. A test the flaky log already names is filed as a
// backlog P3 Flaky bead carrying its lines. A test and its subtests fail
// together and share one bead, so where an open bead already stands for them
// it is noted with the run's log line instead, and a flake that names a
// test with its subtests files or notes once. The run's own line ends its
// head with the beads it tested (the bead of the session that ran the gate,
// else the beads a train's integration gives, YARDR_TEST_BEADS), so a reader
// knows which change the run was of. Where the yardr CLI is not there the
// log line stays the record.
//
// The rerun's output replaces the first run's, so the log line keeps what the
// first run printed for each failed test, behind a separator: the test's
// `--- FAIL:` line and the lines under it (a subtest has a block of its own,
// its parent's holds it), at most 6 lines of 200 bytes (a longer one as
// its first 120 and its last 77 around three dots), joined by a backslash and
// an n, and 20 blocks to a line. With no FAIL line, one block
// keeps a timeout's panic line and running tests, a fatal error's or panic's
// line and the dump's head, else the first output lines, and a timeout names
// its running tests, a fatal error or panic its crashing test, in the head,
// filing as failures do. The printed line stays short. Only the
// part before the separator says which tests flaked: a line without it, as
// the log held before the separator existed, is all of it.
//
// A failure the disk caused is no flake (yardr-4pwj). A failed test whose first
// run's block (its FAIL line and the lines under it) holds "no space left on
// device", or a failed package with no named test whose output holds it, is
// named as the disk's in one line beside the rerun's result, with the df of
// the volume the run keeps its files on, and is left out of the flaky line, the
// log and the filing, even where the log already names it twice: a run with
// nothing else prints no flaky line, and a test that failed for a reason of its
// own in the same run is a flake as before. The failed packages still run
// again; one that hits the disk again fails the step as a package that fails
// twice does, with a line for the disk's state, and writes no flake.
//
// A row is a whole run of the script, 2 to 3 s apiece, and the rows run in
// parallel: the root package has little room under R1's 60 s (yardr-fvkm).
// A case for flakyopen, flakyfile or diskfailed goes in
