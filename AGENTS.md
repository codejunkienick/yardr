# AGENTS.md

yardr routes beads of work to whoever works them. One Go module
(`yardr.dev/yardr`), one binary, one store (bbolt) with one writer. Start
with `README.md` (concepts) and `.yardr/depot.md` (how this depot is
worked); user docs live in `docs/` and are not repeated here.

## Layout

- `main.go`, `main_test.go`, `yardtest_test.go`: entry (routes to
  `cli.Execute`) and the root black-box suites, over the built binary and
  the test gate itself.
- `install.sh`: the one way yardr is installed and the only definition of
  where it goes (`~/.local/bin`), from a release or with `--from-source`;
  POSIX sh, tested in `contrib/release`. A release carries it beside the
  archives, never inside them (footplate and the site's sync refuse an
  archive member they do not know), and names it in `checksums.txt` with
  the archives, so that the signature on the checksums covers it and the
  site's sync, which takes it only against that line, accepts it.
- `internal/`: all Go code, one package per area (below). Nothing outside
  `internal/` imports it except `main` and the tests.
- `docs/`: user and design docs, including `docs/api.md` (the socket API
  contract), `docs/testing.md` (the test rules), `docs/design/`, `docs/flows/`;
  `docs/docs.go` beside them embeds the top-level pages in the binary (`yardr docs`).
- `packs/`: packs shipped inside the binary (`packs/packs.go` embeds them);
  per-service and per-depot-kind directories. `pageframe` is neither: the
  default page frame, one HTML file, with `testdata/` holding the fragment its
  tests dress. One is not embedded: `template`, the skeleton a new source pack
  is copied from.
- `harnesses/`: one `<kind>.yaml` per agent harness kind, embedded and read
  by `internal/agents`.
- `contrib/`: operator and developer tools, each with its own README
  (assembly, bench, burn, deploy, github-mint, isolated-yard,
  peer, release, server-yard, shot). google-mint is no longer here: each
  google pack under `packs/` carries it as its declarations' mint command.
  `contrib/server-yard/managers` installs the stand-in service managers
  that the server-yard suite and the yard-shape matrix
  (`contrib/isolated-yard/matrix_test.go`, run by the quiet run alone) both
  run the server-yard script against.
- `conformance/bdp`: BDP's provider kit run at `yardr bdp serve`
  (`probe-core.sh`), as CI's conformance job runs it at the commit its README pins.
  `probe-core-test.sh` drives that script through the paths a healthy server never
  shows. CI runs it, and so does the gate for a change under `conformance/`, through
  the Go test beside it (`YARDR_CONFORMANCE`, which `.yardr/test` sets).
- `.yardr/`: the yard's own rules for this depot: `depot.md`, the `test`
  gate, `flows/`, `roles/`, `security_paths` (the paths a reviewer may not
  call `done-safe` for).
- `.github/workflows/`: CI (`ci.yml`) and release.

## Packages (`internal/`)

To find your way inside one, run `go doc -short ./internal/<pkg>` first:
it lists every exported name with its comment, faster than grepping.

- `agents`: what yardr knows of each harness kind (models, login recipes)
  and the fetch data `yardr doctor` reports; not herdr's agent state.
- `bdp`: serves the yard over HTTP as the Bead Protocol's Core reads;
  `docs/bdp.md`, Conformance, says what yardr claims.
- `chat`: the `yardr chat` terminal UI (bubbletea); not the socket API it
  reads through.
- `cli`: cobra commands, one file per area, registered in `root.go`; no
  business logic, which lives in the package the command calls.
- `config`: yard settings, the home layout, `YARDR_*` environment, and
  running operator-configured commands for what they print.
- `depotfile`: reads a depot's standing working-rules file.
- `dispatch`: the daemon's pass: wakes on a committed write, re-reads
  state, routes beads, runs the crew, keeps backups, sends the daily
  telemetry batch when the operator turned it on; never polls.
- `diskkeep`: keeping the machine's disk free for landings' builds
  (GOCACHE rotation, stale go-tmp), run by `yardr disk keep`.
- `edgelink`: the yard's side of the edge (`yardr edge connect`): fetching
  the edge's key and enrolling the yard by a code, each call signed with the
  yard's key (the member and preview reports among them), and the link
  `yardr server` keeps open to it (dialled, challenged, every frame checked,
  served with the listener's mux); the edge itself is the `yardr-hosted`
  router, not here.
- `eta`: arrival-time estimates and the arrivals board rows.
- `flowdraw`: flows drawn as SVG signalling diagrams (generated into
  `docs/flows/`); the drawing holds no beads.
- `hooks`: receives webhooks (GitHub, Linear, …), routes envelopes into
  yard events; declared-source notifiers live here too.
- `limits`: what a harness subscription still carries, answered by the
  operator's command through a yard source; no provider logic.
- `mcp`: the yard as an MCP server for a person's own client: the tool
  contract (names, schemas, plain-words results) defined once, and the
  local stdio server (`yardr mcp`) as one adapter over it; the edge's
  remote endpoint is another adapter, not here.
- `notify`: one message to a person through the source their record names;
  decides nothing about what is told.
- `otel`: trace context plus a hand-written OTLP/HTTP exporter; no SDK.
- `pack`: reading, checking, planning and applying packs.
- `pairing`: the pairing request paths under the peers' listener; a leaf.
- `peer`: who is on the other end of a unix socket (pid, process tree), so
  the store recognises a call from a session's pane.
- `preview`: the yard's preview supervisor (part of `yardr server`): starts
  approved previews, keeps them running under their caps, captures their
  logs and carries their traffic on its yard-side endpoint; serves the
  files of a bead's worktree as a watch, which runs nothing; reports each
  preview to the edge, which answers the host it is opened at.
- `previewtest`: the app a preview's tests run: the test binary started
  again by the supervisor as a listener that serves its directory and logs
  each request, in place of `python3 -m http.server`, which asks the
  resolver for its own name before it listens; a package whose tests start
  it calls `MaybeServe` first in its `TestMain`.
- `rpc`: the store API over a local unix socket (`POST /call/<Method>`);
  the client is generated from `store.API`.
- `runner`: starts work: herdr agents and exec commands in worktrees at
  `<root>/<depot>/<bead>`.
- `scripttest`: stand-in scripts for tests (one launcher, symlinks to it).
- `server`: the `yardr server` process: owns the store, serves the socket,
  re-execs itself on upgrade.
- `source`: declared sources: declarations, credentials, mints, calls; the
  operator's provider logic lives in commands, not here. `known/` holds the
  sources yardr carries for `yardr source add <name>` (aiquokka's limits
  source: no pack, since a pack may not bring a `limits` key).
- `standin`: fake Linear/GitHub APIs and the edge for tests and tryouts,
  written from the services' docs and the design, not recorded.
- `store`: the bbolt store and `API`, the interface everything uses
  (`*Store` in the owning process, `rpc.Client` elsewhere); migrations are
  `migrate_NNN_*.go`.
- `storetest`: throwaway stores for tests; with `YARDR_TEST_RPC=1` they
  talk over a real unix socket.
- `testload`: the factor of a test run, the larger of the one the gate gives
  a loaded race leg (`YARDR_TEST_LOAD`) and the machine's own load as a wait
  is armed; `Scale` makes a wait written for an idle box that many times
  longer, and `Loaded` says the factor is above 1; the contrib suites'
  fuses go through `Scale`; `PreferRealGit` puts git itself ahead of
  macOS's shim on PATH, for a suite whose tests make many git calls.
- `telemetry`: the opt-in telemetry switch, install id, day builder and
  the one POST of a batch to the compiled endpoint, behind `yardr
  telemetry on|off|show` and the daemon's telemetry pass; when to send,
  and the day's attempt, are `dispatch`'s.
- `version`: build identity, noticing when the binary was replaced, and
  keeping the daemon's own descriptors out of what it execs (self-replace,
  an exec group's command, the quiet run).
- `web`: the browser UI: server-rendered pages plus htmx; routes in
  `server.go`, CSS/JS in `assets/`.
- `yardkey`: making the yard's keypair and the request, link and frame
  signatures over the store's key types; no HTTP servers.
- `yards`: talking to peer yards (caller and receiver sides).

## Where to start

- New command: a method on `*app` in `internal/cli/<area>.go` returning a
  `*cobra.Command`, registered in `root.go`'s `AddCommand`; interactive
  forms use `huh` (see `groupform.go`), output goes through `a.out` so
  `--json` holds. A group (subcommands, no Run) gets its refusal of an
  unknown subcommand from `rootCmd` (`refuseStray`): give it no `Args`.
- New socket call: a method on `store.API` in `internal/store/api.go`,
  implemented on `*Store`; `go generate ./internal/rpc` rewrites the
  client, and the server exposes it as `POST /call/<Method>` by
  reflection (`internal/rpc/server.go`). If programs outside yardr may
  rely on it, add it to `Calls` in `internal/rpc/api.go` and `docs/api.md`.
- New web page: a handler in `internal/web/<area>.go` plus a route in
  `server.go`'s `routes()`; static files live in `internal/web/assets/`.
- New TUI: the bubbletea model in `internal/chat/`; the command that opens
  it is in `internal/cli/chat.go`.
- New pack: a directory under `packs/` plus its name in the `//go:embed`
  line in `packs/packs.go`.
- New harness kind: `harnesses/<kind>.yaml`; `agents.Harness` in
  `internal/agents` says what each field means.
- New store migration: `internal/store/migrate_NNN_<name>.go`, following
  the previous one.
- New permission gate in the store: an `Action` in
  `internal/store/policy.go` with its rule in `coreRules`, asked through
  `may` (`w.may`, `s.may`); a gate never compares the actor with a role
  or the operator setting itself, so a `Policy` set with `SetPolicy`
  decides every gate.

## Conventions

- Comments explain why, in full sentences, beside the code they justify;
  names match their neighbours. Prefer extending what is there over a new
  concept, flag or special case.
- Errors are lowercase prose built with `fmt.Errorf`, context outside and
  `%w` inside; expected cases are sentinels (`ErrNotFound`) that callers
  match with `errors.Is`.
- Files are lowercase, one area per file; tests live beside the code as
  `*_test.go`.
- A user doc, a pack's `SETUP.md`, a help text or a message the product
  prints is read on any yard, on Linux or macOS: it carries no path,
  version or fact of the machine it was written on (no `/Users/<name>`,
  no `/opt/homebrew`, no "this machine's", no version seen in a shell,
  no host name of its own: an example names a placeholder such as
  `yard.example.net`, and the root package's `TestNoFileNamesAMachineHost`
  holds every tracked file, tests too, to that);
  an install step names the tool's own install page and gives both
  platforms' commands where they differ, Homebrew as one way on macOS
  and never the only way; sample output uses `~` and the placeholder
  names the page declares; a bead id names a thing only in a design doc
  or an example that is plainly an example, never a promise of future
  work.
- Fixtures: throwaway stores from `internal/storetest`, stand-in scripts
  from `internal/scripttest`; wait on the effect, not on wall time. A
  package whose tests start a real yardr names its test binary to the
  servers it starts: its `TestMain` calls `storetest.NameTestBinary()`,
  which also gives the yardr it runs a long wait for a server to start
  (`YARDR_TEST_START_WAIT`).
- A wait in a contrib suite (a fuse against a hang, the deadline of a poll)
  is written for an idle box and goes through `testload.Scale`: the factor
  is the machine's load over its cores, 1 to 4, the larger of the one the
  gate gives the race leg (`YARDR_TEST_LOAD`) and the machine's own as the
  wait is armed, so no wait is raised by hand after it flakes in a landing.
  What a test measures, and what it gives the program under test as a
  deadline, does not go through it.
- A test package with 250 or more git calls invokes
  `testload.PreferRealGit()` in its `TestMain`, after it strips the `GIT_`
  variables from the environment; a smaller suite is left as it is. The
  count is a git first on PATH that appends a line to a file and execs the
  system's, over one `go test -count=1`: the tests', the code under test's
  and the scripts' calls alike. On macOS the git PATH finds is a shim that
  starts the real one, so each call is two execs, and a big suite makes
  thousands. It puts git's own directory first on PATH for the test process
  and what it starts, and leaves PATH as it is on any other system, or where
  a person's git is first already. It does not reach a git that runs under a
  PATH the suite builds itself (contrib/isolated-yard's `D/e`, an explicit
  `PATH=`).
- The test rules are `docs/testing.md` (per-package time budget, sleep
  budget, parallelism); the gate is `sh .yardr/test` in the worktree, and
  its printed `test:` line is the record of a run. A gate that finds a
  volume it writes to under its free-space floor (`floorgib`) prints one
  line and exits 2, with no test line: that is the machine's disk, not the
  change (docs/testing.md, The disk floor).
- A non-test Go file over 1000 lines has a ceiling that only falls (the
  `filesizes` table in `.yardr/test`), so a listed file cannot grow by a line
  and one with no row fails at 1000. Before planning a change to a Go file near
  or over 1000 lines, run `sh .yardr/test sizes [path]`: it reports each file's
  lines, ceiling and room in seconds, runs no gate step and exits 0, where the
  gate would fail the file only at its end. The gate also warns of every file
  with fewer than 50 lines of room under its ceiling, including listed files.
- The gate sets `GOFLAGS=-trimpath`, so one worktree's cached builds and
  test results serve the others. A source file's path in a trace or from
  `runtime.Caller` is then its import path: a test finds a repo file from
  its package directory (`../../packs/starter`) or through `packs.FS`.
- A `test: flaky:` line files itself: a failed package reruns once, and
  a pass on rerun appends one line to `yardr-flaky.log` in the git common
  dir, which the repo owns and every worktree shares: date, short sha,
  tests and packages, then `beads=<ids>` naming the change the run tested
  where it can say. A test the log already names files a backlog P3
  `Flaky: <Test> (<pkg>)`, or notes the open bead that already stands for
  it: its own, its top-level test's, or another subtest's of that test,
  matched by title and package. A test and its subtests fail together and
  share one bead, filed or noted once. Filing and noting are skipped where
  the yardr CLI is not there. A race fails the step without a retry, and
  a package that fails twice fails as before.
  The rerun's output replaces the first run's, so the log line also keeps
  what the first run printed for each failed test, behind ` | `: its
  `--- FAIL:` line and the lines under it (6 lines of 200 bytes at
  most for a test, a longer line as its first 120 and last 77 bytes
  around `...`, each cut moved off the middle of a multibyte character,
  20 tests at most, a literal `\n` between lines); a
  failure with no `--- FAIL:` line keeps its timeout's panic line and
  running tests, its fatal error's or panic's line and the dump's head,
  else its first output lines, and a timeout names its running tests, a
  fatal error or panic its crashing test, in the head. The line ends with
  the load the gate measured as it wrote it (`load <avg> on <cores>
  cores`, or `load unknown`), so a flake on a quiet machine reads apart
  from one under load. The filed bead or the note carries the whole line.
  Only the part before the ` | ` names the tests that flaked and the beads
  the run was of. A hand reading old lines files or notes a repeat the
  same way, and files a failure that accuses the product (a race report,
  a product assertion, a wrong result rather than a timeout) as a bug, not
  a flake; otherwise the log line is the record, named in the handover
  note.
- `gofmt`, `go vet` and `shellcheck` are clean on every change: shellcheck
  over `.yardr/test`, `install.sh` and every `contrib` and `conformance`
  script with a shell shebang, as CI's scan job has it, and the gate fails
  where it is not installed rather than skip it. The module builds with the
  Go in `go.mod`.

## What not to touch

- `internal/rpc/client_gen.go`: generated; change `internal/store/api.go`
  and run `go generate ./internal/rpc`.
- `docs/flows/*.svg`: generated by `internal/flowdraw/gen`; change the
  flows or `internal/flowdraw`.
- Git-ignored build outputs (`/yard`, `*.test`, `/dist`,
  `conformance/bdp/node_modules/`); there is no `vendor/` directory.
- `.yardr/depot.md` holds the yard's rules for builders. One of them: a
  change that moves or adds a package updates this map (AGENTS.md) in the
  same commit.
