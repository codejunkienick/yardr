// Package serveryard tests the server-yard script: that one run sets a
// yard up as the server steps of docs/install.md say, that herdr's unit
// carries the proxy and CA variables of the script's environment, that a
// second run changes nothing, and that where a step cannot be taken the
// script stops with the way on. Each test builds yardr from the tree and
// runs the script with stand-ins for herdr (fake/, a socket and a CLI that
// answer what a setup asks), the harness, systemctl, loginctl and, on
// macOS, launchctl, with HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME and YARDR_HOME in a temp
// dir. The systemctl and launchctl stand-ins model the manager starting a
// unit: herdr's server and the daemon really start (the daemon late, or
// not at all, where a test says so); the web view's unit is only marked,
// since starting it would bind 127.0.0.1:8791.
