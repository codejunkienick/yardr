// The timeout watcher of merge-local never leaves its sleep behind: when
// its test command finishes, the watcher and its sleep go with the run,
// and when merge-local itself is killed with TERM, both go with it (an
// orphaned sleep once held the machine race lock past the run:
// yardr-tsms). The sleep also starts with no inherited file open: every fd
// above 2 closed.
//
// These tests run merge-local directly, without a yard: a throwaway
// repository with base main and branch yard/r-1 in its worktree, a stub
// yardr that says yes to every move, and a sleep that records the fds it
// was started with. The run inherits open files above 2, as a race run
// holds its lock: filler to fd 9, the lock stand-in at fd 10, and one high
// sentinel under the process's own open-files limit, which the limit may
// be too low for. Those above 9 only for an sh that can close them: dash
// reads one digit as a redirection's number, so a run under it is given
// the filler alone, and the scripts refuse the rest (see closefds). Nothing
// else of the test binary's reaches a run: prepare marks what it holds
// close-on-exec first, as the exec runner does, and the strays the rows plant
// to prove it are open without the flag only while no fork can begin
// (holdStray), so no row's stray is another run's.
