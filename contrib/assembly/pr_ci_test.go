// pr-ci the way an exec group runs it for a pr bead in ciwait: merge-pr's yard
// (the contributors pack's pr flow, the group's env_file, stand-ins for gh and
// github-mint), a bare repository for the remote origin that keeps a pull
// request's head where GitHub keeps it (refs/pull/<n>/head), and a depot whose
// test command is a script of the base, as yardr's .yardr/test is, which does
// what a test chose through files in the stand-in's directory. A pull request's
// commit is made in a clone of that remote, so the depot has it only once
// pr-ci has fetched it.
//
// Each case has a yard of its own (a copy of the template yard, which is
// cheaper than a run of the script), so the cases run beside one another. A
// bead in ciwait carries reviewed_head, the commit its reviewer recorded
// before it reported done, as the pr flow's bead does. One that waited in
// triage first carries accepted_head too, the commit a maintainer accepted.
