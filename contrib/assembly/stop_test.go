package assembly

// What an assembly script leaves behind when its session ends. The daemon
// stops a script as soon as it has reported, by signalling its process group
// with TERM, and a session can be stopped before that: what the script
// started (its test command and everything below it) and what it made (its
// temporary files and directory) must be gone by then, and when it is
// stopped. Three things pin it:
//
//   - reportWatch, the yard's own store looking at what the script made at each
//     report, so that every run of every script in this package is held to
//     "nothing of the run is left at bead done" (yard.exec);
//   - the TERM tests of merge-local and integrate-train (watcher_test.go,
//     integrate_train_watcher_test.go), which hold their test command's child
//     to dying with the script, and the removal to surviving a second stop;
//   - the TERM test of the scripts that have a directory or a file to take
//     away and nothing else to stop, run under dash (below).
//
// A second stop is the daemon's: it signals a session's process group on every
// pass until the session is gone, so a script taking its files away is sent
// TERM again, and so is the rm it has started, which dies of it unless the
// script ignored TERM first (gateRm).
