// post-review the way an exec group runs it for a bead of the public line in
// one of its two posting stages: the real yardr.public flow of this repository
// in the yard, the group's env_file giving the App's id and key file, merge-pr's
// stand-in mint, and a stand-in gh that keeps one pull request's state in a
// directory, refuses a call that does not carry the mint's token, and takes a
// review as GitHub does: it keeps what it was posted, and refuses to let the
// account that opened a pull request approve it or ask changes of it. What the
// reviewer did is the metadata the bead carries into the stage: the head it read
// and the review it stored.
