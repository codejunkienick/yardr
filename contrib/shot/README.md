# contrib/shot

One shell script, run by hand in a builder's session: the reference the
builder's role points at for a screenshot of a web page (design
`yardr-wm32`, bead 6.5).

**shot** takes a URL and a file and writes a 1280x800 PNG of the page with
headless Chrome:

```sh
contrib/shot/shot <url> <file>
```

The window is 1280 wide, or `SHOT_WIDTH` pixels where that is set
(`SHOT_WIDTH=390 contrib/shot/shot <url> <file>` is a phone's width), and 800
high either way. The page is laid out for a window of that width, not cropped
from a wider one. Widths under 500 go through a same-machine frame, so the
layout width is exact; a page that forbids framing is refused. A `SHOT_WIDTH`
that is not a positive number is refused, naming it, before Chrome runs.

The URL is `http://` or `https://`, and the file is not a symbolic link:
anything else is refused. It refuses a page that is not there and a file that cannot be written, with
the reason, before Chrome runs — headless Chrome itself exits 0 however the
page loaded, so the script fetches the page first with curl and checks the
shot afterwards. The check bypasses the proxy for a loopback page
(127.0.0.0/8, ::1, localhost), the way Go's clients do; a remote page goes
through the proxy the box sets. Chrome is `SHOT_CHROME` where that names
an executable, else the first of `google-chrome`, `google-chrome-stable`,
`chromium` and `chromium-browser` on `PATH`, else the macOS application; it
runs against a throwaway profile, so the shot never touches the operator's
own. Chrome gets `SHOT_TIMEOUT` seconds to finish, a minute when that is
unset; a slower shot fails with `shot: chrome did not finish within ...` and
what Chrome printed so far.

A page whose assets arrive late can be shot before they do: headless
Chrome shoots as the page finishes loading, so a CDN typeface still on
its way shows as its fallback face, or as no text at all. `SHOT_WAIT`
seconds waits them out (`SHOT_WAIT=5 contrib/shot/shot <url> <file>`
holds the shot five virtual seconds for late arrivals); unset or empty,
the shot goes as Chrome finishes loading, as before. A `SHOT_WAIT` that
is not a positive number is refused, naming it, before the page is
fetched.

A page that answers 4xx or 5xx counts as not there, with the status in the
reason: an error page and a missing route can answer with the same status and
the same body, so only the person shooting can say the page is meant to.
`SHOT_ANY_STATUS=1` says so (`SHOT_ANY_STATUS=1 contrib/shot/shot <url> <file>`
shoots a refusal page, a 429 or a 503): the page is shot if it sends a body,
and refused as an empty answer, naming the status, if it sends none, since
there is nothing to render and Chrome shoots nothing for it, or its own error
page. A connection error, a timeout and a redirect loop are refused either
way. Unset, empty or `0` leaves the switch off, and any other value is
refused, naming `SHOT_ANY_STATUS`, before the page is fetched.

The builder's role (`packs/starter/roles/builder.md`, and the same text in the
design, website and contributors packs) quotes the script's flags and its
`SHOT_ANY_STATUS=1` switch; a test fails when the two drift
(`TestBuilderRoleQuotesTheShotFlags`). Where the page needs driving first (a
click, a scroll), the role names `agent-browser screenshot` instead; a depot
may carry its own shot script, named by its README or `.yardr/depot.md`.
